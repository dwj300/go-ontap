// LunClone This sub-object is used in POST to create a new LUN as a clone of an existing LUN, or PATCH to overwrite an existing LUN as a clone of another. Setting a property in this sub-object indicates that a LUN clone is desired. Consider the following other properties when cloning a LUN: `auto_delete`, `qos_policy`, and `space.guarantee.requested`.<br/> When used in a PATCH, the patched LUN's data is over-written as a clone of the source and the following properties are preserved from the patched LUN unless otherwise specified as part of the PATCH: `class`, `auto_delete`, `lun_maps`, `serial_number`, `status.state`, and `uuid`.<br/> Persistent reservations for the patched LUN are also preserved. 
type LunClone struct {
	Source LunCloneSource `json:"source,omitempty"`
}
