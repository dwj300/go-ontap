// NvmeNamespaceSpaceGuarantee Properties that request and report the space guarantee for the NVMe namespace.
type NvmeNamespaceSpaceGuarantee struct {
	// The requested space reservation policy for the NVMe namespace. If _true_, a space reservation is requested for the namespace; if _false_, the namespace is thin provisioned. Guaranteeing a space reservation request for a namespace requires that the volume in which the namespace resides also be space reserved and that the fractional reserve for the volume be 100%.<br/> The space reservation policy for an NVMe namespace is determined by ONTAP.
	Requested bool `json:"requested,omitempty"`
	// Reports if the NVMe namespace is space guaranteed.<br/> This property is _true_ if a space guarantee is requested and the containing volume and aggregate support the request. This property is _false_ if a space guarantee is not requested or if a space guarantee is requested and either the containing volume and aggregate do not support the request.
	Reserved bool `json:"reserved,omitempty"`
}
