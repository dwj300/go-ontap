type VolumeSnaplockRetention struct {
	// Specifies the default retention period that is applied to files while committing them to the WORM state without an associated retention period. The retention value represents a duration and must be specified in the ISO-8601 duration format. The retention period can be in years, months, days, hours, and minutes. A duration specified for years, months, and days is represented in the ISO-8601 format as \"P<num>Y\", \"P<num>M\", \"P<num>D\" respectively, for example \"P10Y\" represents a duration of 10 years. A duration in hours and minutes is represented by \"PT<num>H\" and \"PT<num>M\" respectively. The retention string must contain only a single time element that is, either years, months, days, hours, or minutes. A duration which combines different periods is not supported, for example \"P1Y10M\" is not supported. Apart from the duration specified in the ISO-8601 format, the duration field also accepts the string \"infinite\" to set an infinite retention period.
