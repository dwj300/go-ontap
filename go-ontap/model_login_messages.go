// The login banner and message of the day (MOTD) configuration. 
type LoginMessages struct {
	Links *InlineResponse201Links `json:"_links,omitempty"`
	// The login banner text. This message is displayed during SSH and console device login just before the password prompt displays. When configured, a cluster-level login banner is used for every incoming connection. Each data SVM can override the cluster-level banner to instead display when you log into the SVM. To restore the default setting for a data SVM, set the banner to an empty string. New lines are supplied as either LF or CRLF but are always returned as LF. Optional in the PATCH body. 
	Banner string `json:"banner,omitempty"`
	// The message of the day (MOTD). This message appears just before the clustershell prompt after a successful login. When configured, the cluster message displays first. If you log in as a data SVM administrator, the SVM message is then printed. The cluster-level MOTD can be disabled for a given data SVM using the \"show_cluster_message\" property. New lines are supplied as either LF or CRLF but are always returned as LF. Optional in the PATCH body. 
	Message string `json:"message,omitempty"`
	Scope *NetworkScope `json:"scope,omitempty"`
	// Specifies whether to show a cluster-level message before the SVM message when logging in as an SVM administrator. This setting can only be modified by the cluster administrator. Optional in the PATCH body. 
	ShowClusterMessage bool `json:"show_cluster_message,omitempty"`
	Svm *AuditSvm `json:"svm,omitempty"`
	// The unique identifier (ID) of the login messages configuration. 
	Uuid string `json:"uuid,omitempty"`
