// Igroup An initiator group (igroup) is a collection of Fibre Channel (FC) world wide port names (WWPN), and/or iSCSI Qualified Names (IQNs), and/or iSCSI EUIs (Extended Unique Identifiers) that identify host initiators.<br/> Initiator groups are used to control which hosts can access specific LUNs. To grant access to a LUN from one or more hosts, create an initiator group containing the hosts' initiator names, then create a LUN map that associates the initiator group with the LUN.<br/> An initiator can appear in multiple initiator groups. An initiator group can be mapped to multiple LUNs. A specific initiator can be mapped to a specific LUN only once.<br/> All initiators in an initiator group must be from the same operating system. The initiator group's operating system is specified when the initiator group is created.<br/> When an initiator group is created, the `protocol` property is used to restrict member initiators to Fibre Channel (_fcp_), iSCSI (_iscsi_), or both (_mixed_).<br/> Zero or more initiators can be supplied when the initiator group is created. After creation, initiators can be added or removed from the initiator group using the `/protocols/san/igroups/{igroup.uuid}/initiators` endpoint. See [`POST /protocols/san/igroups/{igroup.uuid}/initiators`](#/SAN/igroup_initiator_create) and [`DELETE /protocols/san/igroups/{igroup.uuid}/initiators/{name}`](#/SAN/igroup_initiator_delete) for more details.<br/>
type Igroup struct {
	Links InlineResponse201Links `json:"_links,omitempty"`
	// An option that causes the initiator group to be deleted when the last LUN map associated with it is deleted. Optional in PATCH only; not available in POST. This property defaults to _false_ when the initiator group is created.
	DeleteOnUnmap bool `json:"delete_on_unmap,omitempty"`
	// The initiators that are members of the group. Optional in POST.<br/> Zero or more initiators can be supplied when the initiator group is created. After creation, initiators can be added or removed from the initiator group using the `/protocols/san/igroups/{igroup.uuid}/initiators` endpoint. See [`POST /protocols/san/igroups/{igroup.uuid}/initiators`](#/SAN/igroup_initiator_create) and [`DELETE /protocols/san/igroups/{igroup.uuid}/initiators/{name}`](#/SAN/igroup_initiator_delete) for more details.
	Initiators []IgroupInitiatorNoRecords `json:"initiators,omitempty"`
	// All LUN maps with which the initiator is associated.<br/> There is an added cost to retrieving property values for `lun_maps`. They not populated for either a collection GET or an instance GET unless explicitly requested using the `fields` query parameter. See [`DOC Requesting specific fields`](#docs-docs-Requesting-specific-fields) to learn more.
	LunMaps []IgroupLunMaps `json:"lun_maps,omitempty"`
	// The name of the initiator group. Required in POST; optional in PATCH.<br/> Note that renaming an initiator group must be done in a PATCH request separate from any other modifications.
	Name string `json:"name,omitempty"`
	// The host operating system of the initiator group. All initiators in the group should be hosts of the same operating system. Required in POST; optional in PATCH.
	OsType string `json:"os_type,omitempty"`
	// The protocols supported by the initiator group. This restricts the type of initiators that can be added to the initiator group. Optional in POST; if not supplied, this defaults to _mixed_.<br/> The protocol of an initiator group cannot be changed after creation of the group.
	Protocol string   `json:"protocol,omitempty"`
	Svm      AuditSvm `json:"svm,omitempty"`
	// The unique identifier of the initiator group.
	Uuid string `json:"uuid,omitempty"`
