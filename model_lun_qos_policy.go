// LunQosPolicy The QoS policy for the LUN. Both traditional and adaptive QoS policies are supported. If both property `qos_policy.uuid` and `qos_policy.name` are specified in the same request, they must refer to the same QoS policy. To remove the QoS policy from a LUN, leaving it with no QoS policy, set property `qos_policy.name` to an empty string (\"\") in a PATCH request. Valid in POST and PATCH.<br/> Note that a QoS policy can be set on a LUN, or a LUN's volume, but not both.
