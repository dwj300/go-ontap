  x-ntap-long-description: "## Overview\nThese APIs enable you to perform a number\
    \ of independent workflows, including:\n* Creating the cluster\n* Adding nodes\
    \ to the cluster\n* Managing cluster configuration data (including name, version,\
    \ NTP servers, name servers, and DNS domains)\n* Managing node configuration data\
    \ (including node names, models, serial numbers, and HA group information)\n*\
    \ Discovering the nodes on the cluster network that can be added to the cluster\n\
    * Viewing and updating current and recent jobs\n* Updating the cluster software\n\
    ### Pre-Cluster APIs\nA few of the cluster APIs (namely, POST/OPTIONS on /api/cluster,\
    \ GET/HEAD/OPTIONS on /api/cluster/nodes, and calls on /api/cluster/jobs) are\
    \ allowed before the cluster is created.  These APIs support creation of the cluster\
    \ and monitoring of its progress. Any other cluster API used before the cluster\
    \ is created will fail.\n## APIs\n***\n### cluster\nThe cluster APIs cover basic\
    \ management of the cluster, including viewing and modifying settings such as\
    \ the name, UUID, version, NTP servers, DNS domains, and the nodes in the cluster.\
    \  POST /api/cluster allows creation of the cluster, including adding all of the\
    \ nodes to the cluster available during setup, initial configuration of cluster\
    \ and node management interfaces, NTP servers, name servers, licenses, and node\
    \ names.\n***\n### nodes\nThe node APIs allow you to gather information about\
    \ the nodes in a cluster, including model number, serial number, HA Group information,\
    \ names, management interfaces, and UUIDs.  By setting a query parameter, the\
    \ administrator can also discover nodes on the cluster network that have not been\
    \ added to the cluster and use that information in the POST operation to add them.\
    \  Nodes can be added to the cluster through the POST API.\n***\n### jobs\nThe\
    \ job APIs are used to monitor the progress of running and recent jobs using GET.\
    \  Some jobs are capable of being paused and cancelled using the PATCH operation.\n\

  x-ntap-long-description: "## Overview\nThe ONTAP networking APIs enable reporting\
    \ on networking information, such as IPspaces, interfaces, routes, ports, service\
    \ policies and broadcast domains. Some can also be used to manage networking.\n\
    <br/>\n---\n## IPspaces\nIPspaces enable you to configure a single ONTAP cluster\
    \ so that it can be accessed by clients from more than one administratively separate\
    \ network domain, even if those clients are using the same IP address subnet range.\
    \ This allows for separation of client traffic for privacy and security.<br/>\n\
    An IPspace defines a distinct IP address space in which storage virtual machines\
    \ (SVMs) reside. Ports and IP addresses defined for an IPspace are applicable\
    \ only within that IPspace. A distinct routing table is maintained for each SVM\
    \ within an IPspace, so that no cross-SVM or cross-IPspace traffic routing occurs.\n\
    <br/>\n---\n## Ethernet\n### Broadcast Domains\nA broadcast domain is a set of\
    \ ports which would all receive a broadcast packet that is sent from any of the\
    \ ports.<br/>\nBy accurately representing the physical network with an ONTAP broadcast\
    \ domain, ONTAP ensures that IP interfaces are able to migrate to appropriate\
    \ ports in case of failure. ONTAP also ensures that characteristics, such as MTU,\
    \ stay matched across all ports of the broadcast domain.<br/>\nA broadcast domain\
    \ resides in an IPspace, and can be used by cluster-scoped or SVM-scoped IP interfaces\
    \ in that IPspace. The scope of the broadcast domain's uniqueness is the IPspace\
    \ it is in. You must create as many broadcast domains in an IPspace as there are\
    \ IP subnets with interfaces in that IPspace.<br/>\nPorts are mapped to an IPspace\
    \ by assigning the port's broadcast domain.\n### Ports\nA port is a physical or\
    \ virtual Ethernet network device. Physical ports may be combined into Link Aggregation\
    \ Groups (LAGs, or ifgrps), or divided into Virtual LANs (VLANs).<br/>\nThe GET\
    \ and PATCH APIs are available for all port types. The POST and DELETE APIs are\
    \ available for \"lag\" and \"vlan\" port types.<br/>\nA given port can host zero\
    \ or more IP interfaces.<br/>\nA port exists in a broadcast domain and all ports\
    \ within the same broadcast domain must have layer 2 network connectivity to one\
    \ another. If a port within a broadcast domain goes down, any IP interfaces hosted\
    \ by that port can fail over to other ports in the same broadcast domain.\n <br/>\n\
    ---\n## Fibre Channel\n### Interfaces\nFibre Channel (FC) interfaces are the logical\
    \ endpoints for Fibre Channel network connections to an SVM. A Fibre Channel interface\
    \ provides Fibre Channel access to storage within the interface's SVM using either\
    \ Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP) or Non-Volatile Memory Express over Fibre Channel\
    \ (NVMe over FC).<br/>\nThe Fibre Channel interface REST API allows you to create,\
    \ delete, update and discover Fibre Channel interfaces and obtain status information\
    \ for Fibre Channel interfaces.<br/>\nA Fibre Channel interface is created on\
    \ a Fibre Channel port that is located on a cluster node. The Fibre Channel port\
    \ must be specified to identify the location of the interface for a POST or PATCH\
    \ that relocates an interface. You can identify the port by either supplying the\
    \ node and port names or the port UUID.\n### Ports\nFibre Channel ports are the\
    \ physical ports of Fibre Channel adapters on ONTAP cluster nodes that can be\
    \ connected to Fibre Channel networks to provide Fibre Channel network connectivity.\
    \ A Fibre Channel port defines the location of a Fibre Channel interface within\
    \ the ONTAP cluster.<br/>\nThe Fibre Channel port REST API allows you to discover\
    \ Fibre Channel ports, obtain status information for Fibre Channel ports, and\
    \ configure Fibre Channel port properties.\n### Learn More\n* _Fibre Channel Logins_\
    \ found in both the _SAN_ and _NVMe_ sections. Fibre Channel logins represent\
    \ connections formed by Fibre Channel initiators that have successfully logged\
    \ in to ONTAP.\n---\n## IP\n### Interfaces\nAn interface (also referred to as\
    \ a _LIF_ in ONTAP documentation) represents a network access point to a node\
    \ in a cluster. In other words, an interface is essentially an IPv4 or IPv6 address\
    \ with associated attributes.<br/>\nIP interfaces are configured on ports to send\
    \ and receive communications over the network. The port that will host the interface\
    \ can either be explicitly specified using node and/or port fields or implicitly\
    \ specified using a broadcast domain.<br/>\nThe IPspace of the interface is required\
    \ for cluster-scoped interfaces. The SVM owning the interface is required for\
    \ SVM-scoped interfaces. These interfaces are in the SVM's IPspace.<br/>\nThe\
    \ service policy of an interface defines what network services are provided by\
    \ the interface.\n### Routes\nRoutes indicate which IPv4 or IPv6 gateway to use\
    \ to communicate with hosts that are not on the local subnet. Typically, an IP\
    \ interface (or LIF) can only use a gateway if it has the same address family\
    \ and is in the LIF's subnet.<br/>\nIt is important that every gateway address\
    \ belongs to a physical or virtual router that has connectivity to the specified\
    \ destination network.<br/>\nSVM-scoped routes can only be used by IP interfaces\
    \ of the specified SVM. Likewise, cluster-scoped routes can only be used by cluster-scoped\
    \ IP interfaces in the specified IPspace.\n### Service Policies\nService policies\
    \ are named groupings that define what services are supported by an IP interface.\
    \ These include both built-in service policies (for example: default-data-files\
    \ or default-management) and custom service policies.<br/>\nService policies are\
    \ scoped to either an SVM or IPspace.\n<br/>\n---\n"

  description: "Manages storage virtual machines (SVMs)"
  x-ntap-long-description: "## Overview\nStorage Virtual Machine (SVM) APIs enable\
    \ you to manage SVMs and their attributes, including the configuration of the\
    \ CIFS and NFS protocols, export policies, name mappings between CIFS and NFS\
    \ users, and network services.\n<br/>SVMs contain data volumes and one or more\
    \ network interfaces through which they serve data to the clients. SVMs securely\
    \ isolate the shared virtualized data storage and network, and each SVM appears\
    \ as a single dedicated server to the clients. Each SVM has a separate administrator\
    \ authentication domain, and each SVM can be managed independently by its SVM\
    \ administrator.\n<br/>In a cluster, SVMs facilitate data access. A cluster must\
    \ have at least one SVM to serve data. Multiple SVMs can coexist in a single cluster\
    \ without being bound to any particular node in the cluster. However, they are\
    \ bound to the physical cluster on which they exist.\n<br/>SVMs with volumes can\
    \ contain files and LUNs. They provide file-level data access by using NFS and\
    \ CIFS protocols for the NAS clients, and block-level data access by using iSCSI\
    \ and Fibre Channel (FC) (FCoE included) for SAN hosts. The volumes within each\
    \ NAS SVM are related to each other through junctions and they are mounted on\
    \ junction paths. These junctions present the file system in each volume. The\
    \ root volume of the SVM resides at the top level of the namespace hierarchy;\
    \ additional volumes are mounted to the SVM root volume to extend the namespace.\
    \ As volumes are created for the SVM, the root volume of the SVM contains junction\
    \ paths.\n<br/>The ONTAP REST APIs only expose data SVMs as an SVM. The information\
    \ and configuration associated with the cluster and nodes are exposed from REST,\
    \ but the cluster and nodes are not treated as if they are a type of SVM from\
    \ REST APIs. Some APIs that expose both cluster-owned resources and SVM-owned\
    \ resources from the same endpoint only return and support the \"svm\" sub-object\
    \ for the resources that are within a data SVM. In those endpoints, the resources\
    \ that are not in a data SVM do not return the \"svm\" sub-object. Generally,\
    \ such endpoints have a \"scope\" attribute that returns either \"svm\" or \"\
    cluster\" to identify the resource as either a cluster-level resource or one that\
    \ is completely contained in a data SVM.\n"

  x-ntap-long-description: "## Overview\nONTAP uses name-services to obtain information\
    \ about users and clients. This information is used to authenticate users accessing\
    \ data on or administering the storage system, and to map user credentials in\
    \ a mixed environment. If the user database is stored in NIS or LDAP servers,\
    \ NIS and LDAP name services need to be configured in ONTAP.\nDNS is used for\

    \ formed by Fibre Channel initiators, that have successfully logged in to ONTAP.\
    \ This represents the Fibre Channel login on which higher-level protocols, such\
    \ as Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP) and Non-Volatile Memory Express over Fibre Channel\
    \ (NVMe over FC), rely.<br/>\nThe Fibre Channel logins REST API provides information\
    \ about active Fibre Channel logins.\n### WWPN Aliases\nA WWPN (world wide port\
    \ name) is a unique 64-bit identifier for a Fibre Channel initiator. It is displayed\
    \ as a 16-character hexadecimal value. SAN administrators may find it easier to\
    \ identify Fibre Channel initiators using an alias, especially in larger SANs.<br/>\n\
    The WWPN alias REST API allows you to create, delete and discover aliases for\
    \ WWPNs.\n### Services\nA Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP) service defines the properties\
    \ of the Fibre Channel Protocol target for an SVM. There can be at most one FCP\
    \ service for a given SVM. An SVM's FCP service must be created before FCP initiators\
    \ can login to the SVM.<br/>\nThe Fibre Channel Proctocol (FCP) service REST API\
    \ allows you to create, update, delete, and discover Fibre Channel Services for\
    \ SVMs.\nFibre Channel interfaces are the logical endpoints for Fibre Channel\
    \ network connections to an SVM.\n---\n## iSCSI\n### Credentials\nAn iSCSI credentials\
    \ object defines the authentication credentials to be used between an iSCSI initiator\
    \ and ONTAP. It identifies an authentication type, user names, and the passwords\
    \ that must be used to authenticate a specific initiator.<br/>\nThe iSCSI credentials\
    \ REST API allows you to create, update, delete, and discover iSCSI credential\
    \ objects.\n### Services\nAn iSCSI service defines the properties of the iSCSI\
    \ target for an SVM. There can be at most one iSCSI service for an SVM. An SVM's\
    \ iSCSI service must be created before iSCSI initiators can login to the SVM.<br/>\n\
    The iSCSI service REST API allows you to create, update, delete, and discover\
    \ iSCSI services for SVMs.\n### Sessions\nAn iSCSI session consists of one or\
    \ more TCP connections that link an iSCSI initiator with an iSCSI target. TCP\
    \ connections can be added and removed from an iSCSI session by the iSCSI initiator.\
    \ Across all TCP connections within an iSCSI session, an initiator sees one and\
    \ the same target. After the connection is established, iSCSI control, data, and\
    \ status messages are communicated over the session.<br/>\nThe iSCSI sessions\
    \ REST API provides information about iSCSI initiators that have successfully\
    \ logged in to ONTAP.\n### Learn More\n* _IP Interfaces_ found in the _networking_\
    \ section. IP interfaces are the logical endpoints for iSCSI network connections\

    \ of Fibre Channel WWPNs (world wide port names), iSCSI IQNs (qualified names),\
    \ iSCSI EUIs (extended unique identifiers), or any combination of these, that\
    \ identify host initiators.<br/>\nInitiator groups are used to control which hosts\
    \ can access specific LUNs. To grant access to a LUN from one or more hosts, a\
    \ network administrator creates an initiator group containing the hosts' initiator\
    \ names, and then creates a LUN map that associates the initiator group with the\
    \ LUN.<br/>\nThe initator group REST API allows you to create, update, delete,\
    \ and discover initiator groups. It also enables you to add and remove initiators\
    \ that can access the target and associated LUNs.\n## LUN Maps\nA LUN map is an\
    \ association between a LUN and an initiator group. When a LUN is mapped to an\
    \ initiator group, the group's initiators are granted access to the LUN. The relationship\
    \ between an initiator group and a LUN is many initiator groups to many LUNs.<br/>\n\
    The LUN map REST API allows you to create, delete, and discover LUN maps.\n##\
    \ LUNs\nA LUN is the logical representation of storage in a storage area network\
    \ (SAN).<br/>\nThe LUN REST API allows you to create, update, delete, and discover\
    \ LUNs.\n"

- name: "application"
  description: "Manages applications"
  x-ntap-long-description: "## Overview\nONTAP application APIs simplify storage management\
    \ by using terminology specific to a type of application. This application-specific\
    \ terminology can be used to provision and manage ONTAP storage objects. A single\
    \ call using application-specific parameters provisions storage and enables protocol\
    \ access for an application following NetApp best practices. You can view and\
    \ manage the ONTAP objects making up the application as a group using the application\
    \ APIs. The library of available application templates already includes several\
    \ database and virtualization applications.\n## APIs\nThere are several application\
    \ APIs that must be used to fully manage an application. Templates are used to\
    \ represent any parameters specific to a given application. Some APIs expose applications\
    \ in terms of their specific template, while others only expose a generic view\
    \ that all applications share. The template view is present on the _templates_\
    \ and _applications_ APIs (although these APIs do also include some generic fields).\
    \ The _components_ and _snapshots_ APIs are entirely generic and do not differ\
    \ across types of applications.\n<br/>The following section provides an overview\
    \ of each API, followed by a lifecycle example of managing an application to demonstrate\
    \ how the APIs can be used together.\n***\n### Template\nA template is an ONTAP\
    \ representation of a specific type of application. Each template represents one\
    \ type of application, the parameters that can be used to customize it, the layout\
    \ of its storage, and how it can be accessed. Templates are intended to expose\
    \ an application in terms specifically applicable to an administrator of a given\
    \ application. As such, traditional ONTAP storage elements are generally not included\
    \ in an application template.\n<br/>The template APIs can be used to discover\
    \ what templates are currently available. The ONTAP API documentation also includes\
    \ a model of the templates. The template APIs generally provide the same information\
    \ as the documentation, but the template APIs might provide more up-to-date details\
    \ about the default values of template parameters based on the current ONTAP configuration.\
    \ However, only the ONTAP API documentation includes a full description of each\
    \ template parameter, its usage, and whether it is optional.\n***\n### Application\n\
    The application APIs are the only interfaces that allow management of an application\
    \ using template properties.\n<br/>The application object includes the following\
    \ three sections:\n1. Generic metadata about the application, including common\
    \ fields such as the name of the application, the template used to provision it,\
    \ and the generation number of the application.\n2. Statistics information about\
    \ the application, including space and IOPS details about the entire application\
    \ and each of its components. These are expensive to collect and should only be\
    \ requested when needed using a _fields=_ query.\n3. A template view of the application.\
    \ The application object itself presents a mutually exclusive list of all possible\
    \ templates. Only one of these fields can be used per application. The name of\
    \ the field corresponds to the name of the template used by the application. Currently,\
    \ the creation of a new application and the modification of the storage service\
    \ for an existing application are supported through the template parameters.\n\
    ***\n### Component\nThe component API offers a generic view of the application\
    \ and how to access the application from the host application. This is the only\
    \ API that exposes the underlying ONTAP storage elements of which the application\
    \ is composed. It is read-only; it cannot support modifications specific to the\
    \ type of application it is presenting.\n<br/>The component object includes the\
    \ following details for an application:\n1. The NFS export rules for accessing\
    \ the application from the host.\n2. The CIFS share and users that can access\
    \ the application from the host.\n3. The SAN initiators that can access the application\
    \ from the host.\n4. For IP-based protocols, the IP addresses that are best suited\
    \ for accessing the component.\n5. The underlying storage elements that make up\
    \ the component, such as volumes or LUNs.\n***\n### Snapshot copy\nThe Snapshot\
    \ copy APIs offer full CRUD for application-level Snapshot copies. Application\
    \ Snapshot copies can be flagged as either crash-consistent or application-consistent.\
    \ From the perspective of ONTAP, there is no difference between the two. It is\
    \ the responsibility of the administrator to ensure that the application is in\
    \ a consistent state before flagging a Snapshot copy as application-consistent.\
    \ Use of the SnapCenter Backup Management suite is recommended to ensure correct\
    \ interaction between host applications and ONTAP.\n***\n## Example\nThe following\
    \ example outlines the APIs necessary to manage applications and how they fit\
    \ together. However, this example does not provide detailed information on each\
    \ API. See the documentation for the individual APIs for more information.\n###\
    \ 1) Discover the templates\nThis documentation, which includes the model of each\
    \ template as part of the _templates_ and _applications_ APIs, is the easiest\
    \ and most comprehensive way to discover the available templates. The _templates_\
    \ API can also be used to query the system for templates in a programmatic way.<br/>\n\
    To discover the templates available to provision an Oracle application, the following\
    \ query is used.\n---\n```\n# The API:\n/api/application/templates\n# The query:\n\
    name=oracle*\n# The call:\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/application/templates?name=oracle*\"\
    \ -H \"accept: application/json\"\n# The response:\n{\n  \"records\": [\n    {\n\
    \      \"name\": \"oracle_on_nfs\", \"description\": \"Oracle using NFS.\"\n \
    \   },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"oracle_on_san\", \"description\": \"Oracle using\
    \ SAN.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"oracle_rac_on_nfs\", \"description\"\
    : \"Oracle RAC using NFS.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"oracle_rac_on_san\"\
    , \"description\": \"Oracle RAC using SAN.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"num_records\":\
    \ 4\n}\n```\n---\n### 2) Create an application\nNow that we know the possible\
    \ templates, we use one to create an application. The template properties differ\
    \ from template to template, and can be found by exploring the model of the application\
    \ object in this documentation. Each call to create an application must include\
    \ the properties for exactly one template. These properties are provided under\
    \ the property with the same name as the template. Other than the template properties,\
    \ the only other required properties to create an application are the SVM and\
    \ name.\n<br/>Note: In the following call example, not all of the template properties\
    \ are included. Where a property is not needed or the default is sufficient, the\
    \ property can be excluded. In this case using the _oracle_on_nfs_ template, the\
    \ _archive_log_, _nfs_access_ and _protection_type_ are not included. The template\
    \ name, _oracle_on_nfs_, is specified above the group of template properties,\
    \ after the names of the application and the SVM.\n<br/>Creating an application\
    \ is asynchronous, so the response for this API includes information about the\
    \ job doing the work. The response header also includes the _location_ of where\

    \ includes a state and a message to indicate the progress of the job. When the\
    \ job is complete, and the application has been fully created, the message indicates\
    \ success and the _state_ of the job property is _success_.\n<br/>For brevity\
    \ purposes, the successful job response is shown here. On a real cluster, an application\
    \ might take several seconds to several minutes to be created, depending on the\
    \ system load. If the job is not complete, the _message_ property includes a short\
    \ description on the progress of the job, and the _state_ indicates _running_.\n\

    \ the application directly without listing all the applications. Use the _location_\
    \ header that is included in the response when the application is created.\n<br/>Note:\
    \ The following example uses a query to retrieve only a small number of the application's\

    \ },\n  \"generation\": 2,\n  \"state\": \"online\"\n}\n```\n---\n### 5) Discover\
    \ how to access the application\nThe components API provides information on how\
    \ to access the storage that is provisioned for the application.\n<br/>For brevity,\
    \ only the names of the components are requested. See the API documentation for\
    \ more information on the other available fields.\n---\n```\n# The API:\napi/application/applications/{application.uuid}/components\n\
    # The query:\nfields=name\n# The call:\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/application/applications/dbc10d87-df5a-11e7-b5d2-005056b47eb2/components?fields=name\"\

    \ }\n  ],\n  \"num_records\": 3\n}\n```\n---\n### 6) Update the application\n\
    To update the storage service, the same template that is used for creating the\
    \ application is reused, but with only the storage_service properties set. In\
    \ the generic SAN and NAS templates, the name of each component must also be specified.\n\
    <br/>In this example, the cluster only supports the _value_ storage service, so\
    \ modifications of the application to a faster storage service fail. Note how\
    \ the error message indicates the parameter that caused the problem.\n<br/>Application\
    \ modification, like application creation, is an asynchronous operation. If a\
    \ valid command is passed, the API returns information about the job instead of\
    \ an error.\n---\n```\n# The API:\n/api/application/applications/{uuid}\n# The\
    \ body:\n{\n  \"oracle_on_nfs\": { \"db\": { \"storage_service\": { \"name\":\
    \ \"extreme\" } } }\n}\n# The call:\ncurl -X PATCH \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/application/applications/dbc10d87-df5a-11e7-b5d2-005056b47eb2\"\

    \ for parameter \\\"oracle_on_nfs.db.storage-service.name\\\": extreme. Supported\
    \ values are: value.\",\n    \"code\": \"65995152\"\n  }\n}\n```\n---\n### 7)\
    \ Manage Snapshot copies\nFor applications created with the _local_ _protection_type_\
    \ set to _hourly_, Snapshot copies are automatically taken every hour. These Snapshot\
    \ copies can be retrieved or restored using the Snapshot copy APIs. Snapshot copies\
    \ can also be taken on demand using these APIs. It is important to note that the\
    \ _consistency_type_ flag of the Snapshot copy is for record-keeping only: it\
    \ is the responsibility of the administrator to ensure that the application is\
    \ in a consistent state prior to flagging a Snapshot copy as _application_ consistent.\n\
    <br/>Take a Snapshot copy manually:\n---\n```\n# The API:\n/api/application/applications/{uuid}/snapshots\n\
    # The body:\n{\n    \"name\": \"little_bobby_tables\",\n    \"consistency_type\"\

    \ body is empty, and the response header includes the _location_ of the newly\
    \ created Snapshot copy. By default, all POST calls return an empty body unless\
    \ a job is used to process the creation asynchronously. This behavior can be changed\
    \ with the query flag _return_records_.\n<br/>Restoring a Snapshot copy uses an\
    \ action API. Action paths can also be performed asynchronously as jobs, as with\

    ### Template versus generic\nApplications can be represented in either template\
    \ or generic terms. All applications can be represented in generic terms as a\
    \ list of components. Each component generally maps to a field in the template.\
    \ For example, Microsoft SQL Server applications have a component named _sqldata_\
    \ that corresponds to the _db_ parameter in the sql_on_san template. These mappings\
    \ are usually straightforward and allow the templates to present application terminology,\
    \ while the generic view uses the traditional naming schemes for ONTAP storage\
    \ elements.\n<br/>The current release supports the creation and modification of\
    \ applications in template terms, but retrieval is not supported. The mapping\
    \ from template to generic terms is left to your own discretion.za\n### ONTAP\
    \ feature support\nApplication APIs are interfaces layered on top of traditional\
    \ ONTAP storage. While the intent is to provide a full management suite through\
    \ application APIs, some features of the underlying ONTAP objects are not directly\
    \ supported through application APIs. Applications are provisioned using ONTAP\
    \ best practices, so the need for additional modifications of the underlying objects\
    \ should be minimal. If such modifications are necessary, the traditional ONTAP\
    \ APIs can be used. The _/api/application/{application.uuid}/components_ API provides\
    \ a _backing_storage_ field that can be used to locate the storage objects associated\
    \ with an application. This API also provides details of the NFS, CIFS, or SAN\
    \ protocol access objects associated with the application.\n<br/>The application\
    \ APIs use the extra information known about the application to coordinate multiple\
    \ ONTAP objects in unison. When using non-application APIs, certain settings might\
    \ interfere with the ONTAP object coordination and cause the application APIs\
    \ to behave unexpectedly. To continue to supply the full ONTAP feature set, these\
    \ modifications on the underlying objects are allowed, but there is no guarantee\
    \ that these modifications will not adversely affect the application experience.\
    \ You should use this feature with caution.\n"

    \ data by drawing upon a vault of backups or, in the event that a primary is unusable,\
    \ by using a disaster recovery copy that can be activated for clients and applications.\
    \ SnapMirror periodically updates a replica to create new backups and/or to keep\
    \ a replica up-to-date with changes that have been written to the primary. The\

    \ settings for an SVM. You can delete or update NFS configurations, and you can\
    \ also disable or enable different NFS features as needed.\n### Exports\nThe export\
    \ APIs allow you to create and manage export policies for an SVM that enable an\
    \ administrator to restrict access to volumes for clients that match specific\
    \ IP addresses and specific authentication types. Export APIs are also used to\
    \ create export rules for an export policy. The APIs allow each rule to specify\
    \ the number of mask bits in the client IP address that must be matched for that\
    \ rule to apply to a particular client request. The APIs also allow each export\
    \ rule to specify the authentication types that are required for both read-only\
    \ and read-write operations.\n### Kerberos\nKerberos is a protocol designed to\
    \ provide strong authentication for users and hosts within a client/server environment.\
    \ The basis of the protocol is a shared, secret-key cryptology system. (Kerberos\
    \ uses shared-key encryption to ensure the confidentiality of the data. It also\
    \ uses hashing techniques to ensure the integrity of the data (so that no one\
    \ can modify the data unless allowed to do so). With the NetApp multiprotocol\
    \ storage platform, through which clients based on UNIX or Windows can access\
    \ data using CIFS or NFS, it is crucial to provide the ability to use standard\
    \ network services for authentication and for identity storage.<br/>\nTo configure\
    \ an ONTAP system to use Kerberos for NFS, Kerberos must be enabled on a data\
    \ LIF in the SVM that owns the NFS server. A Kerberos realm needs to be created\
    \ before enabling Kerberos on a data LIF. (The Kerberos realm is needed so that\
    \ the cluster knows how to format Kerberos ticket requests.) The Kerberos APIs\
    \ allow you to define, create, modify, and delete realms for the SVM. The APIs\
    \ also allow you to enable/disable Kerberos on a data LIF and update the Kerberos\
    \ interface configuration for a particular data LIF in the SVM.\n"

      description: "Creates an application.\n### Template properties\nThe application\
        \ APIs appear to be complex and long in this documentation because we document\
        \ every possible template, of which there are currently 14. When creating\
        \ an application, only a single template is used, so it is best to focus only\
        \ on the template of interest. Other than the properties for the chosen template,\
        \ only the `name` and `svm` of the application must be provided. The following\
        \ three sections provided guidelines on using the properties of the templates,\
        \ but the whole idea behind the templates is to automatically follow the best\
        \ practices of the given application, so the only way to determine the exact\
        \ list of required properties and default values is to dig in to the model\
        \ section of the template. The templates are all top level properties of the\
        \ application object with names matching the values returned by [`GET /application/templates`](#operations-application-application_template_collection_get).\n\
        ### Required properties\n* `svm.uuid` or `svm.name` - The existing SVM in\
        \ which to create the application.\n* `name` - The name for the application.\n\
        * `<template>` - Properties for one template must be provided. In general,\
        \ the following properties are required, however the naming of these may vary\
        \ slightly from template to template.\n  * `name` - The generic templates\
        \ require names for the components of the application. Other templates name\
        \ the components automatically.\n  * `size` - This generally refers to the\
        \ size of an application component, which may be spread across multiple underlying\
        \ storage objects (volumes, LUNs, etc...).\n  * `igroup_name` - All SAN applications\
        \ require an initiator group to be specified in some way.\n  * `os_type` -\
        \ All SAN applications require an os_type to be specified in some way. Some\
        \ templates refer to this as the `hypervisor`.\n### Recommended optional properties\n\
        * `<template>` - The following properties are available in some templates.\n\
        \  * `new_igroups.*` - SAN applications can use existing initiator groups\
        \ or create new ones. When creating new initiator groups, `new_igroups.name`\
        \ is required and the other properties may be used to fully specify the new\
        \ initiator group.\n### Default property values\nIf not specified in POST,\
        \ the follow default property values are assigned. It is recommended that\
        \ most of these properties be provided explicitly rather than relying upon\
        \ the defaults. The defaults are intended to make it as easy as possible to\
        \ provision and connect to an application, but likely provide more access\
        \ to the application than is necessary.\n* `template.name` - Defaults to match\
        \ the `<template>` provided. If specified, the value of this property must\
        \ match the provided template properties.\n* `<template>` - The majority of\
        \ template properties have default values. The defaults may vary from template\
        \ to template. See the model of each template for complete details. In general\
        \ the following patterns are common across all template properties. The location\
        \ of these properties varies from template to template.\n  * `storage_service.name`\
        \ - _value_\n  * `nfs_access.host` - _0.0.0.0/0_\n  * `nfs_access.access`\
        \ - _rw_\n  * `cifs_access.user_or_group` - _everyone_\n  * `cifs_access.access`\
        \ - _full_access_\n  * `protection_type.local_rpo` - _hourly_ (Hourly Snapshot\
        \ copies)\n  * `protection_type.remote_rpo` - _none_ (Not MetroCluster)\n\
        \  * `new_igroups.os_type` - Defaults to match the `os_type` provided for\
        \ the application, but may need to be provided explicitly when using virtualization.\n\
        ### Optional components\nA common pattern across many templates are objects\
        \ that are optional, but once any property in the object is specified, other\
        \ properties within the object become required. Many applications have optional\
        \ components. For example, provisioning a database without a component to\
        \ store the logs is supported. If the properties related to the logs are omitted,\
        \ no storage will be provisioned for logs. But when the additional component\
        \ is desired, the size is required. Specifying any other property of a component\
        \ without specifying the size is not supported. In the model of each template,\
        \ this is documented in the description of each property. When a `size` property\
        \ is listed as optional, that means the component itself is optional, and\
        \ the size should be specified to include that component in the application.\n\
        ### POST body examples\n1. Create a generic SAN application that exposes four\

        \ component object exposes how to access an application. Most application\
        \ interfaces abstract away the underlying ONTAP storage elements, but this\
        \ interface exposes what is necessary to connect to and uses the storage that\
        \ is provisioned for an application. See the application component model for\
        \ a detailed description of each property.\n### Query examples\nQueries are\
        \ limited on this API. Most of the details are nested under the `nfs_access`,\
        \ `cifs_access`, or `san_access` properties, but those properties do not support\
        \ queries, and properties nested under those properties cannot be requested\
        \ individually in the current release.<br/>\nThe following query returns all\
        \ application components with names beginning in _secondary_.<br/><br/>\n\
        ```\nGET /application/applications/{application.uuid}/components?name=secondary*\n\

      description: "## Overview\nApplications support Snapshot copies across all member\

        \ time or as scheduled. Most applications have hourly Snapshot copies enabled\
        \ by default, unless the RPO setting is overridden during the creation of\
        \ the application. An application Snapshot copy can be flagged as either _application\
        \ consistent_, or _crash consistent_. From an ONTAP perspective, there is\
        \ no difference between these two consistency types. These types are available\
        \ for record keeping so that Snapshot copies taken after the application is\
        \ quiesced (application consistent) can be tracked separately from those Snapshot\
        \ copies taken without first quiescing the application (crash consistent).\
        \ By default, all application Snapshot copies are flagged to be _crash consistent_,\
        \ and Snapshot copies taken at a scheduled time are also considered _crash\
        \ consistent_.<br/>\nThe functionality provided by these APIs is not integrated\
        \ with the host application. Snapshot copies have limited value without host\

        \ main groups or properties.\n* Generic properties - such as the `name`, `template.name`,\
        \ and `state` of the application. These properties are all inexpensive to\
        \ retrieve and their meaning is consistent for every type of application.\n\
        * `statistics.*` - application statistics report live usage data about the\
        \ application and its components. Various space and IOPS details are included\
        \ at both the application level and at a per component level. The application\
        \ model includes a detailed description of each property. These properties\
        \ are slightly more expensive than the generic properties because live data\
        \ must be collected from every storage element in the application.\n* `<template>`\
        \ - the property corresponding to the value of the `template.name` returns\
        \ the contents of the application in the same layout that was used to provision\
        \ the application. This information is very expensive to retrieve because\
        \ it requires collecting information about all the storage and access settings\
        \ for every element of the application. There are a few notable limitations\
        \ to what can be returned in the `<template>` section:\n  * The `new_igroups`\
        \ array of many SAN templates is not returned by GET. This property allows\
        \ igroup creation in the same call that creates an application, but is not\
        \ a property of the application itself. The `new_igroups` array is allowed\
        \ during PATCH operations, but that does not modify the `new_igroups` of the\
        \ application. It is another way to allow igroup creation while updating the\
        \ application to use a different igroup.\n  * The `vdi_on_san` and `vdi_on_nas`\
        \ `desktops.count` property is rounded to the nearest 1000 during creation,\
        \ and is reported with that rounding applied.\n  * The `mongo_db_on_san` `dataset.element_count`\
        \ property is rounded up to an even number, and is reported with that rounding\
        \ applied.\n  * The `sql_on_san` and `sql_on_smb` `server_cores_count` property\
        \ is limited to 8 for GET operations. Higher values are accepted by POST,\
        \ but the impact of the `server_cores_count` property on the application layout\
        \ currently reaches its limit at 8.\n### Learn more\n* [`DOC /application`](#docs-application-overview)\n"

        \ to creating an application, modification is done using the template properties\
        \ of an application. The `storage_service`, `size`, and `igroup_name` of an\
        \ application may be modified.\n### `storage_service`\nStorage service modifications\
        \ are processed in place, meaning that the storage can not be moved to a location\
        \ with more performance headroom to accommodate the request. If the current\
        \ backing storage of the application is in a location that can support increased\
        \ performance, the QoS policies associated with the application will be modified\
        \ to allow it. If not, an error will be returned. A storage service modification\
        \ to a lower tier of performance is always allowed, but the reverse modification\
        \ may not be supported if the cluster is over provisioned and the cluster\
        \ is unlikely to be able to fulfil the original storage service.\n### `size`\n\
        Size modifications are processed in a variety of ways depending on the type\
        \ of application. For NAS applications, volumes are grown or new volumes are\
        \ added. For SAN applications, LUNs are grown, new LUNs are added to existing\
        \ volumes, or new LUNs are added to new volumes. If new storage elements are\
        \ created, they can be found using the [`GET /application/applications/{application.uuid}/components`](#operations-application-application_component_collection_get)\
        \ interface. The creation time of each storage object is included, and the\
        \ newly created objects will use the same naming scheme as the previous objects.\
        \ Resize follows the best practices associated with the type of application\
        \ being expanded. Reducing the size of an application is not supported.\n\
        ### `igroup_name`\nModification of the igroup name allows an entire application\
        \ to be mapped from one initiator group to another. Data access will be interrupted\
        \ as the LUNs are unmapped from the original igroup and remapped to the new\
        \ one.\n### Application state\nDuring a modification, the `state` property\
        \ of the application updates to indicate `modifying`. In `modifying` state,\
        \ statistics are not available and Snapshot copy operations are not allowed.\
        \ If the modification fails, it is possible for the application to be left\
        \ in an inconsistent state, with the underlying ONTAP storage elements not\
        \ matching across a component. When this occurs, the application is left in\
        \ the `modifying` state until the command is either retried and succeeds or\
        \ a call to restore the original state is successful.\n### Examples\n1. Change\
        \ the storage service of the database of the Oracle application to _extreme_\
        \ and resize the redo logs to _100GB_.\n    ```\n    {\n      \"oracle_on_nfs\"\
        : {\n        \"db\": {\n          \"storage_service\": {\n            \"name\"\
        : \"extreme\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"redo_log\": {\n        \
        \  \"size\": \"100GB\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n    <br/>\n2.\
        \ Change the storage service, size, and igroup of a generic application by\
        \ component name.\n    ```\n    {\n      \"san\": {\n        \"application_components\"\
        : [\n          {\n            \"name\": \"component1\",\n            \"storage_service\"\
        : {\n              \"name\": \"value\"\n            }\n          },\n    \
        \      {\n            \"name\": \"component2\",\n            \"size\": \"\
        200GB\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"name\": \"component3\",\n\
        \            \"igroup_name\": \"igroup5\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n\
        \    }\n    ```\n    <br/>\n### Learn more\n* [`DOC /application`](#docs-application-overview)\n\

      description: "# Overview\nThis API is used to create a cluster, update cluster-wide\
        \ configurations, and retrieve the current configuration details.\n## Creating\
        \ a cluster\nYou can create a new cluster by issuing a POST request to /cluster.\
        \ Parameters are provided in the body of the POST request to configure cluster-wide\
        \ settings and add nodes during the cluster setup.\n### Fields used for creating\
        \ a cluster\nThe fields used for the cluster APIs fall into the following\
        \ categories:\n### Required cluster-wide configuration\nThe following fields\
        \ are always required for any POST /cluster request:\n* name\n* password\n\
        ### Optional cluster-wide configuration\nThe following fields are used to\
        \ setup additional cluster-wide configuration:\n* location\n* contact\n* dns_domains\n\
        * name_servers\n* ntp_servers\n* license\n* configuration_backup\n* management_interface\n\
        * nodes\n### Nodes field\nThe nodes field specifies the nodes to join to the\
        \ cluster. All nodes must be at the same version to use this API. If no nodes\
        \ are specified, the cluster is configured with one node added. The node added\
        \ is the node to which the REST request is issued. If one node is specified,\
        \ the \"node.cluster_interface.ip.address\" field must not be used. If multiple\
        \ nodes are specified, the node to which the REST request is issued must be\
        \ provided in addition to the remote nodes, and the \"node.cluster_interface.ip.address\"\
        \ field is required for each node to identify them. All other node fields\
        \ are optional in all cases. If a field is provided for one node, it must\
        \ be provided for all nodes.\n### Node networking fields\nThe cluster management\
        \ interface and each node management interface use the cluster management\
        \ interface netmask and gateway. For advanced configurations where the cluster\
        \ and node management interfaces are on different subnets, the /network/ip/interface\
        \ APIs must be used to configure network interfaces after setup is complete.\n\
        The management interfaces are used to communicate with the name servers and\
        \ NTP servers. The address family of the name servers and NTP servers must\
        \ match the management interfaces address family.\n### Single node cluster\
        \ field\nWhen the \"single_node_cluster\" field is set to true, the cluster\
        \ is created in single node cluster mode. A node field for this node can be\
        \ provided for node-specific configuration and the \"node.cluster_interface.ip.address\"\
        \ field must not be used. Storage failover is configured to non-HA mode, and\
        \ ports used for cluster ports are moved to the default IPspace. This might\
        \ cause the node to reboot during setup. While a node reboots, the RESTful\
        \ interface might not be available. See 'Connection failures during cluster\
        \ create' for more information.\n## Performance monitoring\nPerformance of\
        \ the cluster can be monitored by the `metric.*` and `statistics.*` fields.\
        \ These show the performance of the cluster in terms of IOPS, latency and\
        \ throughput. The `metric.*` fields denote an average whereas `statistics.*`\
        \ fields denote a real-time monotonically increasing value aggregated across\
        \ all nodes.\n## Monitoring cluster create status\n### Errors before the job\
        \ starts\nConfiguration in the POST /cluster request is validated before the\
        \ cluster create job starts. If an invalid configuration is found, an HTTP\
        \ error code in the 4xx range is returned. No cluster create job is started.\n\
        ### Polling on the job\nAfter a successful POST /cluster has been issued,\
        \ an HTTP error code of 202 is returned along with a job UUID and link in\
        \ the body of the response. The cluster create job continues asynchronously\
        \ and can be monitored with the job UUID using the /cluster/jobs API. The\
        \ \"message\" field in the response of GET /cluster/jobs/{uuid} shows the\
        \ current step in the job and the \"state\" field shows the overall state\
        \ of the job.\n### Errors during the job\nIf a failure occurs during the cluster\
        \ create job, the job body provides details of the error along with error\
        \ code fields. See the error table in the 'Responses' of the POST /cluster\
        \ documentation for common error codes and descriptions.\n### Re-running POST\
        \ /cluster\nThe POST /cluster command can be re-run if errors occur. When\
        \ re-running the request, the same body and query parameters must be used.\
        \ The value of any field in the original body or query can be changed, but\
        \ the fields that were provided cannot be changed. For example, an initial\
        \ request might have a body section as follows:\n<br />\n---\n```\nbody =\n\
        {\n  \"name\": \"clusCreateRerun\",\n  \"password\": \"openSesame\",\n  \"\
        nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"cluster_interface\": {\n        \"ip\": {\n   \
        \       \"address\": \"1.1.1.1\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n    \
        \  \"cluster_interface\": {\n        \"ip\": {\n          \"address\": \"\
        2.2.2.2\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n---\nA re-run request updates\
        \ the body details to:\n<br />\n---\n```\nbody =\n{\n  \"name\": \"clusCreateRerun\"\
        ,\n  \"password\": \"openSesame\",\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"cluster_interface\"\
        : {\n        \"ip\": {\n          \"address\": \"3.3.3.3\"\n        }\n  \
        \    }\n    },\n    {\n      \"cluster_interface\": {\n        \"ip\": {\n\
        \          \"address\": \"4.4.4.4\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\
        ---\nA re-run request with the following body details is invalid:\n<br />\n\
        ---\n```\nbody =\n{\n  \"name\": \"clusCreateRerun\",\n  \"password\": \"\
        openSesame\",\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"cluster_interface\": {\n   \
        \     \"ip\": {\n          \"address\": \"3.3.3.3\"\n        }\n      }\n\
        \    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n---\nAlso, note that the password might already be configured.\
        \ If a password is already configured and a new password is provided, this\
        \ request overwrites the existing password. If a password is already configured\
        \ either by another interface or by a previous POST to /cluster, any future\
        \ REST requests must be authenticated with that password. If POST to /cluster\
        \ with the default return_timeout of 0 returns an error, then the password\
        \ was not changed.\n### Connection failures during cluster create\nThere are\
        \ two cases where a request to poll the job status might fail during the cluster\
        \ create job. In these cases, programmatic use of the RESTful interface should\
        \ be resilient to these connection failures.\n1. When the \"single_node_cluster\"\
        \ flag is set to true, the node might reboot. During this time, the RESTful\
        \ interface might refuse connections, return errors on GET, or connection\
        \ timeouts might occur. Any programmatic use of the RESTful interface during\
        \ reboots must consider these effects while polling a cluster create job.\n\
        2. The \"mgmt_auto\" LIF is removed during the cluster create job. A POST\
        \ /cluster request might be issued on the \"mgmt_auto\" LIF. However, requests\
        \ to poll the job status might fail during cluster create when the \"mgmt_auto\"\
        \ LIF is removed. The \"mgmt_auto\" LIF is only removed if a cluster management\
        \ interface is provided as an argument to POST /cluster, and only after the\
        \ cluster management interface is created. Programmatic use of the POST /cluster\
        \ API on the \"mgmt_auto\" LIF should be configured to dynamically switch\

        \ example of a cluster \"create\" operation\nThe following is an example of\
        \ how a cluster can be created using the cluster APIs.  This example shows\
        \ the creation of a two node cluster and uses information from the nodes themselves\
        \ combined with user supplied information to configure the cluster.\n### 1)\
        \ Preparing for setup\nBefore the REST APIs can be issued to create the cluster,\
        \ the cluster must be wired up and powered on. The network connections between\
        \ the nodes for the cluster network, as well as the connections to the management\
        \ network, must be completed.  Once the nodes are powered up, the nodes automatically\
        \ configure interfaces on the platform's default cluster ports to allow the\
        \ nodes to discover each other during setup and expansion workflows. You must\
        \ configure a management interface on one node or use the mgmt_auto LIF, which\
        \ is assigned an IP address using DHCP, to start using the REST APIs.  By\
        \ making a console connection to a node, the cluster setup wizard guides you\
        \ through the configuration of the initial node managment interface to which\
        \ the REST calls can be sent.  Once this step is completed, exit the wizard\
        \ by typing \"exit\". You can then issue REST API requests.\n1.  Wire and\
        \ power up the nodes.\n2.  Make a console connection to one node to access\
        \ the cluster setup wizard.\n3.  Enter node management interface information\
        \ to enable REST API requests to be sent to the node.\n---\n```\nWelcome to\
        \ the cluster setup wizard.\nYou can enter the following commands at any time:\n\
        \  \"help\" or \"?\" - if you want to have a question clarified,\n  \"back\"\
        \ - if you want to change previously answered questions, and\n  \"exit\" or\
        \ \"quit\" - if you want to quit the cluster setup wizard.\n  Any changes\
        \ you made before quitting will be saved.\n  You can return to cluster setup\
        \ at any time by typing \"cluster setup\".\n  To accept a default or omit\
        \ a question, do not enter a value.\n  This system will send event messages\
        \ and periodic reports to NetApp Technical\n  Support. To disable this feature,\
        \ enter\n  autosupport modify -support disable\n  within 24 hours.\n  Enabling\
        \ AutoSupport can significantly speed problem determination and\n  resolution\
        \ should a problem occur on your system.\n  For further information on AutoSupport,\
        \ see:\n    http://support.netapp.com/autosupport/\n    Type yes to confirm\
        \ and continue {yes}: yes\n    Enter the node management interface port [e0c]:\n\
        \      Enter the node management interface IP address: 10.224.82.249\n   \
        \   Enter the node management interface netmask: 255.255.192.0\n      Enter\
        \ the node management interface default gateway: 10.224.64.1\n      A node\
        \ management interface on port e0c with IP address 10.224.82.249 has been\
        \ created.\n      Use your web browser to complete cluster setup by accessing\n\
        \      https://10.224.82.249\n      Otherwise, press Enter to complete cluster\
        \ setup using the command line\n      interface: exit\n      Exiting the cluster\
        \ setup wizard. Any changes you made have been saved.\n      The cluster administrator's\
        \ account (username \"admin\") password is set to the system default.\n  \
        \    Warning: You have exited the cluster setup wizard before completing all\n\
        \      of the tasks. The cluster is not configured. You can complete cluster\
        \ setup by typing\n      \"cluster setup\" in the command line interface.\n\
        ```\n---\n### 2) Discovering the nodes\nIssuing a GET /api/cluster/nodes request\
        \ when the nodes are not in a cluster, the API returns a list of nodes that\
        \ were discovered on the cluster network.  Information returned include the\
        \ node's serial number, model, software version, UUID, and cluster interface\
        \ address.  The number of nodes returned should be the same as the number\
        \ of nodes expected to be in the cluster.  If too many nodes are discovered,\
        \ remove those nodes that should not be part of the cluster.  If not enough\
        \ nodes are discovered, ensure all the nodes are powered up, that the connections\
        \ to the cluster network are complete, and retry the command.\n<br />\n---\n\

        ---\n### 3) Creating the cluster\nOnce the node information is available,\
        \ including each node's cluster interface address, the information for creating\
        \ the cluster can be assembled.  You must provide the cluster name and the\
        \ password for the admin account.  The rest of the information is optional\
        \ and can be configured later using other APIs.  Each node to be included\
        \ in the cluster must have the cluster interface address provided so that\
        \ it can be connected to while adding it to the cluster.  In addition to the\
        \ cluster interface address, the optional node name, location, and management\
        \ interface information can be supplied.  If node names are not provided,\
        \ nodes are named based on the cluster name.  The nodes' managment interface\
        \ netmask and gateway values are omitted and must be the same as the cluster\
        \ management interface's netmask and gateway.\n<br />\n---\n```\n# The API:\n\
        /api/cluster\n# The call:\ncurl -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster\"\

        \n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n---\n### 4) Monitoring the progress of cluster\
        \ creation\nTo monitor the progress of the cluster create operation, the job\
        \ link returned should be polled until the state value is no longer \"runnning\"\
        \ or \"queued\".\n<br />\n---\n```\n# The API:\n/api/cluster/jobs/b5bc07e2-19e9-11e9-a751-005056bbd95f\n\
        # The call:\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/jobs/b5bc07e2-1e9-11e9-a751-005056bbd95f\"\
        \ -H \"accept: application/hal+json\"\n# The response:\n{\n  \"uuid\": \"\
        b5bc07e2-19e9-11e9-a751-005056bbd95f\",\n  \"description\": \"POST /api/cluster\"\
        ,\n  \"state\": \"success\",\n  \"message\": \"success\",\n  \"code\": 0,\n\
        \    \"_links\": {\n      \"self\": {\n        \"href\": \"/api/cluster/jobs/b5bc07e2-19e9-11e9-a751-005056bbd95f\"\
        \n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n---\n### 5) Verifying the cluster information\nOnce\
        \ the cluster is created, the information applied can be verified using a\
        \ number of APIs. Most of the information provided can be retrieved using\
        \ the /api/cluster and /api/cluster/nodes APIs. In addition, the network interface\
        \ and route information can be viewed using the /api/network APIs. The following\
        \ example details how to retrieve the cluster information:\n<br />\n---\n\
        ```\n# The API:\n/api/cluster\n# The call:\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster\"\

      description: "## Overview\nLicensing allows you to tailor a system to meet an\
        \ organization's specific needs. New features can be enabled by purchasing\
        \ a license from a NetApp sales associate. After installation of the license,\
        \ the new feature is available immediately.\n####\nThis interface manages\
        \ licenses according to their supported feature. By default, the interface\
        \ displays packages with installed licenses, but you can also return  unlicensed\
        \ packages.\n####\nEach feature has a compliance state which is indicated\
        \ at the package level. Individual licenses also contain a compliance state\
        \ indicated in the 'licenses' array. The state of the package is determined\
        \ by analyzing the underlying licenses according to the following criteria:\n\
        \  * Licensing terms\n  * Cluster state\n### Licensing terms\nThe licensing\
        \ terms define the conditions under which a package is considered 'compliant'.\
        \ Individual licenses are evaluated based on the following:\n  * Scope\n \
        \ * Time period\n  * Usage\n#### Scope\nA package can be licensed under the\
        \ following scopes:\n  * site\n  * cluster\n  * node\n####\nA package licensed\
        \ under 'site' or 'cluster' permits the feature to be used by any node that\
        \ is a member of the cluster.\n####\nA package licensed under 'node' scope\
        \ permits the authorized node to use the feature. Within a cluster, if you\
        \ haven't supplied every node with a valid license, the package state will\
        \ indicate 'noncompliant'. A license must be purchased for each node in a\
        \ cluster for the package to be considered 'compliant'.\n#### Time period\n\
        Some package licenses are only valid for a limited period of time. After a\
        \ license has expired, the package state changes to 'noncompliant'. A new\
        \ license will need to be purchased for the package to return to a  'compliant'\
        \ state.\n#### Usage\nSome package licenses have additional terms that need\
        \ to be maintained to keep a license in compliance. These conditions are defined\
        \ by the individual license. For example, a license might define the maximum\
        \ amount of storage that a node can allocate for the license to be 'compliant'.\n\
        ### Cluster state\nA cluster's state consists of the following:\n  * Node\
        \ online status\n  * Node cluster membership\n####\nSome features require\
        \ that a node be online to display a valid compliance state. If a node can\
        \ not be reached, or is not known to the cluster, the individual license may\
        \ indicate an 'unknown' state.\n## Licensing keys\nA license is issued in\
        \ one of the following two formats:\n  * 26-character key\n  * NetApp License\
        \ File (NLF)\n####\nThe following is an example of a 26-character key:\n####\n\
        \  ```\n    AMEPOSOIKLKGEEEEDGNDEKSJDE\n  ```\n####\nThe following is an example\
        \ of a NLF key:\n####\n```JSON\n{\n  \"statusResp\": {\n  \"version\": \"\
        1\",\n  \"serialNumber\": \"123456789\",\n  \"message\": \"Success\",\n  \"\
        licenses\": {\n    \"capacity\": \"1\",\n    \"type\": \"capacity\",\n   \
        \ \"licenseProtocol\": \"FABRICPOOL-TB\",\n    \"package\": \"FabricPool\"\
        ,\n    \"licenseScope\": \"cluster\"\n  },\n  \"snStatus\": \"Active\",\n\
        \  \"product\": \"fabricpool\",\n  \"statusCode\": \"S007\"\n  },\n  \"Signature\"\
        : \"signatureABC\"\n}\n```\n####\nEither format can be submitted, via this\
        \ API, to enable features.\n####\n---\n## Examples\n### Retrieving a collection\
        \ of licenses organized by package\nThis example retrieves a collection that\
        \ contains one entry for each package (filtered to only the 'fabricpool' package).\n\
        ####\n```JSON\n# API\nGET /cluster/licensing/licenses/?fields=*&name=fabricpool\"\
        \n# Response\n200 OK\n# JSON Body\n{\n  \"records\": [\n  {\n    \"name\"\
        : \"fabricpool\",\n    \"scope\": \"cluster\",\n    \"state\": \"compliant\"\
        ,\n    \"licenses\": [\n    {\n      \"owner\": \"testcluster-1\",\n     \
        \ \"serial_number\": \"4149027342\",\n      \"state\": \"compliant\",\n  \
        \    \"capacity\": {\n      \"maximum_size\": 1099511627776,\n      \"used_size\"\
        : 0\n      }\n    }\n    ],\n    \"_links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"\
        href\": \"/api/cluster/licensing/licenses/fabricpool\"\n    }\n    }\n  }\n\
        \  ],\n  \"num_records\": 1,\n  \"_links\": {\n  \"self\": {\n    \"href\"\
        : \"/api/cluster/licensing/licenses/?fields=*&name=fabricpool\"\n  }\n  }\n\
        }\n```\n### Retrieving a collection of installed licenses\nThis example retrieves\
        \ a collection containing all packages (except base) that have installed licenses.\n\
        ####\n```JSON\n# API\nGET /cluster/licensing/licenses/?fields=*&name=!base\n\
        # Response\n200 OK\n# JSON Body\n{\n  \"records\": [\n  {\n    \"name\": \"\
        nfs\",\n    \"scope\": \"node\",\n    \"state\": \"compliant\",\n    \"licenses\"\
        : [\n    {\n      \"owner\": \"testcluster-1\",\n      \"serial_number\":\
        \ \"1-81-0000000000000004149027492\",\n      \"state\": \"compliant\"\n  \
        \  }\n    ],\n    \"_links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/cluster/licensing/licenses/nfs\"\
        \n    }\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"cifs\",\n    \"scope\": \"node\"\
        ,\n    \"state\": \"compliant\",\n    \"licenses\": [\n    {\n      \"owner\"\
        : \"testcluster-1\",\n      \"serial_number\": \"1-81-0000000000000004149027492\"\
        ,\n      \"state\": \"compliant\"\n    }\n    ],\n    \"_links\": {\n    \"\
        self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/cluster/licensing/licenses/cifs\"\n    }\n\
        \    }\n  }\n  ],\n  \"num_records\": 2,\n  \"_links\": {\n  \"self\": {\n\
        \    \"href\": \"/api/cluster/licensing/licenses/?fields=*&name=!base\"\n\
        \  }\n  }\n}\n```\n### Installing a NLF license\nThis example installs a single\
        \ license in the NLF format.\n####\n**Note**: You must escape all double quotes\
        \ and backslash characeters, of the JSON license, before it can be placed\
        \ in the POST request.\n####\n```JSON\n# API\nPOST /cluster/licensing/licenses/\n\
        # JSON Body\n{\n  \"keys\" : [ \"{\\\"statusResp\\\":{\\\"snStatus\\\": \\\
        \"Active\\\", \\\"licenses\\\": {\\\"package\\\": \\\"FabricPool\\\", \\\"\
        capacity\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"licenseProtocol\\\": \\\"FABRICPOOL-TB\\\", \\\
        \"type\\\": \\\"capacity\\\", \\\"licenseScope\\\": \\\"cluster\\\"}, \\\"\
        message\\\": \\\"Success\\\", \\\"statusCode\\\": \\\"S007\\\", \\\"version\\\
        \": \\\"1\\\", \\\"product\\\": \\\"fabricpool\\\", \\\"serialNumber\\\":\
        \ \\\"4149027342\\\"}, \\\"Signature\\\":\\\"SignatureABC\\\"}\" ]\n}\n# Response\n\
        201 Created\n```\n### Installing a 26-character key\nThis example installs\
        \ a single 26-character key formatted license.\n####\n```JSON\n# API\nPOST\
        \ /cluster/licensing/licenses/\n# JSON Body\n{\n  \"keys\" : [ \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\"\
        \ ]\n}\n# Response\n201 Created\n```\n### Installing multiple licenses with\
        \ one API call\nThis example demonstrates how multiple keys can be provided\
        \ to install multiple features in a single API call.\n####\n```JSON\n# API\n\
        POST /cluster/licensing/licenses/\n# JSON Body\n{\n  \"keys\" : [ \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\"\
        ,\n             \"BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB\" ]\n}\n# Response\n201 Created\n\

      description: "# Overview\nThis API is used to add nodes to a cluster, update\
        \ node-specific configurations, and retrieve the current node configuration\
        \ details.\n## Adding a node to a cluster\nA node can be added to a cluster\
        \ by issuing a POST /cluster/nodes request to a node currently in the cluster.\
        \ All nodes must be at the same version to use this API. Mixed version joins\
        \ are not supported in this release. Properties can be provided as fields\
        \ in the body of the POST request to configure node-specific settings. On\
        \ a successful request, POST /cluster/nodes returns a status code of 202 and\
        \ job information in the body. The /cluster/jobs APIs can be used to track\
        \ the status of the node add job.\n### Fields used for adding a node\nFields\
        \ used for the /cluster/nodes APIs fall into the following categories\n<br/>\n\
        ### Required node fields\nThe following field is required for any POST /cluster/nodes\
        \ request:\n* cluster_interface.ip.address\n### Optional fields\nAll of the\
        \ following fields are used to setup additional cluster-wide configuration:\n\
        * name\n* location\n* records\n### Network interface fields\nEach node can\
        \ have a node-specific configuration set in POST /cluster/nodes. If a field\
        \ is provided in the body of a node, it must be provided for all nodes in\
        \ the POST body.\nThe node management interface can be provided for each node\
        \ if all node management interfaces in the cluster use the same netmask. If\
        \ the node management interfaces use different netmasks, then configuration\
        \ of the node management interfaces should be done using the /network/ip/interfaces\
        \ API.\n<br/>\n### The records field\nMultiple nodes can be added to the cluster\
        \ in one request by providing an array named \"records\" with multiple node\
        \ entries. Each node entry in records must follow the required and optional\
        \ fields listed previously. When only adding a single node, no records field\
        \ is needed. See 'Example usecases' for an example of how to use the records\
        \ field.\n## Modifying node configurations\nThe following fields can be used\
        \ to modify a node configuration:\n* name\n* location\n<br/>\n## Examples\n\
        The following examples show how to shutdown/reboot a node and how to update\
        \ a node configuration.\n### Adding a single node with a minimal configuration\n\

        \ remote IP\nHere the user provides the remote IP address. Creating a new\
        \ cluster peer relationship with a specific remote cluster requires at least\
        \ one remote intercluster IP address from that cluster.\n### Required properties\n\
        \  * `remote.ip_addresses` - Addresses of the remote peers. The local peer\
        \ must be able to reach and connect to these addresses for the request to\
        \ succeed in creating a peer.\n  * Either set `generate_passphrase` to true\
        \ or provide a passphrase in the body of the request; only one of them is\
        \ required.\n### Optional properties\n  The following fields are optional\
        \ for a POST on /cluster/peer/. All fields must follow the structure in the\
        \ cluster peer API definition.\n  * `name` - Name of the peering relationship.\n\
        \  * `passphrase` - User generated passphrase for use in authentication.\n\
        \  * `generate_passphrase` (true/false) - When this option is true, ONTAP\
        \ automatically generates a passphrase to authenticate cluster peers.\n  *\
        \ `ipspace` - IPspace of the local intercluster LIFs. Assumes Default IPspace\
        \ if not provided.\n  * `initial_allowed_svms` - the local SVMs allowed to\
        \ peer with the peer cluster's SVMs. This list can be modified until the remote\
        \ cluster accepts this cluster peering relationship.\n  * `local_network`\
        \ - fields to create a local intercluster LIF. See section on \"Creating local\
        \ intercluster lifs\".\n  * `expiry_time` - Duration in ISO 8601 format for\
        \ which the user-supplied or auto-generated passphrase is valid. Expiration\
        \ time must not be greater than seven days into the future. ISO 8601 duration\
        \ format is \"PnDTnHnMnS\" or \"PnW\" where n is a positive integer. The nD,\
        \ nH, nM and nS fields can be dropped if zero. \"P\" should always be present\
        \ and \"T\" should be present if there are any hours, minutes or seconds fields.\n\
        \  * `encryption_proposed` (none/tls-psk) - Encryption mechanism of the communication\
        \ channel between the two peers.\n### Do not provide remote IP\n  This method\
        \ is used when the remote IP address is not provided. This method is used\
        \ when the filer is ready to accept peering request from foreign clusters.\n\
        ### Required properties\n  * `generate_passphrase` (true) - This option must\
        \ be set to  true. ONTAP automatically generates a passphrase to authenticate\
        \ cluster peers. Either set generate_passphrase to true or provide a passphrase\
        \ in the body of the request; only one of them is required.\n### Optional\
        \ properties\n  The following fields are optional for a POST on /cluster/peer/.\
        \ All fields must follow the structure in the cluster peer API definition.\n\
        \  * `name` - Name of the remote peer.\n  * `ipspace` - IPspace of the local\
        \ intercluster LIFs. Assumes Default IPspace if not provided.\n  * `initial_allowed_svms`\
        \ - Local SVMs allowed to peer with the peer cluster's SVMs. This list can\
        \ be modified until the remote cluster accepts this cluster peering relationship.\n\
        \  * `local_network` - Fields to create a local intercluster LIF. See section\
        \ on \"Creating local intercluster lifs\".\n  * `expiry_time` - Duration in\
        \ ISO 8601 format for which the user-supplied or auto-generated passphrase\
        \ is valid. Expiration time must not be greater than seven days into the future.\
        \ ISO 8601 duration format is \"PnDTnHnMnS\" or \"PnW\" where n is a positive\
        \ integer. The nD, nH, nM and nS fields can be dropped if zero. \"P\" should\
        \ always be present and \"T\" should be present if there are any hours, minutes\
        \ or seconds fields.\n  * `encryption_proposed` (none/tls-psk) - Encryption\
        \ mechanism of the communication channel between the two peers.\n## Additional\

      description: "##  Cluster peer operations\nCluster peering allows administrators\
        \ of ONTAP systems to establish relationships between two or more independent\
        \ clusters. Once a relationship exists between two clusters, they may then\
        \ exchange user data, configuration information and coordinate operations.\
        \ The /cluster/peers endpoint supports operations such as create, get, modify\
        \ and delete using GET, PATCH and POST HTTP requests.\n### Creating a cluster\
        \ peer\nA new cluster peer relationship can be set up by issuing a POST request\
        \ to /cluster/peers. Parameters in the POST body define the settings of the\
        \ peering relationship. A successful POST request that succeeds in creating\
        \ a peer returns a HTTP status code, code 201, along with the details of the\
        \ created peer such as peer UUID, name, authentication information. A failed\
        \ POST request returns an HTTP error code along with a message indicating\
        \ the reason for the error. This can include malformed request and invalid\
        \ operations.\n#### Sample request\n```\ncurl -X POST 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/peers/'\
        \ -d '{\"authentication\":{\"expiry_time\":\"12/25/2018 12:34:56\",\"generate_passphrase\"\
        :true}}'\n```\n##### Examples\n```\n# Create - no params\nbody = {}\n# Create\
        \ with a peer address and a passphrase\nbody =\n{\n    \"remote\":\n     \
        \ {\n          \"ip_addresses\":[\"1.2.3.4\"]\n      }\n}\n# Create with a\
        \ peer name and a generated passphrase that is true\nbody =\n{\n    \"name\"\
        :\"cp_xyz123\",\n    \"authentication\":\n      {\n          \"generate_passphrase\"\
        :true\n      }\n}\n# Create with a name, a peer address, and a passphrase\n\
        body =\n{\n    \"name\":\"cp_xyz123\",\n    \"remote\":\n      {\n       \
        \   \"ip_addresses\": [\"1.2.3.4\"]\n      },\n    \"authentication\":\n \
        \     {\n          \"passphrase\":\"xyz12345\"\n      }\n }\n# Create with\
        \ a proposed encryption protocol\nbody =\n{\n    \"encryption\":\n      {\n\
        \          \"proposed\":\"tls-psk\"\n      }\n}\n```\n## Creating local intercluster\
        \ LIFs\nThe local cluster must have an intercluster LIF on each node for the\
        \ correct operation of cluster peering.\nIf no local intercluster LIFs exist,\
        \ you can optionally specify LIFs to be created for each node in the local\
        \ cluster.\nThese local interfaces, if specified, are created on each node\
        \ before proceeding with the creation of the cluster peering relationship.\
        \ Cluster peering relationship would be established if there is an error preventing\
        \ the LIFs from being created.\nLocal interfaces, once created, should not\
        \ be specified for subsequent cluster peering relationships.\n### Local LIF\
        \ creation fields\n* local_network.ip_addresses - list of IP addresses to\
        \ assign, one per node in the local cluster\n* local_network.netmask - IPv4\
        \ mask or netmask length\n* local_network.broadcast_domain - Broadcast domain\
        \ that is in use within the IPspace.\n* local_network.gateway - The IPv4 or\
        \ IPv6 address of the default router.\n##### Additional information on network\
        \ routes\nIt might happen that when creating LIFs the network route discovery\
        \ mechanism could take additional time (1-5 seconds) to become visible in\
        \ the network outside of the cluster. This delay in publishing the routes\
        \ might cause an initial cluster peer \"create\" request to fail. This error\
        \ disappears with a retry of the same request.\n##### Example\n```\ncurl -X\
        \ POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/peers\" -d body\n```\nwhere \"<mgmt-ip>\"\
        \ is replaced by the IP address of the cluster management LIF,\nand \"body\"\
        \ is replaced by the JSON body of the POST,\ncontaining the fields for the\
        \ new peering relationship and local LIFs.\n##### Example POST body\nTo create\
        \ 4 intercluster LIFs on a 4-node cluster before creating a cluster peer relationship:\n\
        ```\n{\n    \"local_network\":\n    {\n        \"interfaces\": [\n       \
        \     {\"ip_address\":\"1.2.3.4\"},\n            {\"ip_address\":\"1.2.3.5\"\
        },\n            {\"ip_address\":\"1.2.3.6\"}\n            ],\n        \"netmask\"\
        : \"255.255.0.0\",\n        \"broadcast_domain\": \"Default\",\n        \"\
        gateway\": \"1.2.0.1\"\n    }\n    \"remote.ip_addresses\": [\"1.2.9.9\"],\n\
        \    \"authentication.passphrase\": \"xyz12345\"\n}\n```\n## Retrieve a cluster\
        \ peer\nPeers in a cluster can be retrieved by issuing a GET request to /cluster/peers.\
        \ It is also possible to retrieve a specific peer when qualified by its UUID\
        \ to /cluster/peers/{uuid}.\n### Overview of fields used for retrieving a\
        \ cluster peer\nA GET request might have no query parameters or a valid cluster\
        \ UUID. The former retrieves all records while the latter retrieves the record\
        \ for the cluster peer with that UUID.\n#### Required fields\nThere are no\
        \ required fields for GET requests.\n#### Optional fields\nThe following fields\
        \ are optional for GET requests\n* UUID - uuid of the cluster peer\n#####\
        \ Examples\n```\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/peers/\"\ncurl\
        \ -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/peers/{uuid}\"\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/peers/{uuid}?fields=*\"\
        \n```\n## Update a cluster peer\nA cluster peer relationship can be updated\
        \ by issuing a PATCH request to /cluster/peers/{uuid}. As in the CLI mode,\
        \ you can toggle the proposed encryption protocol, update the passphrase,\
        \ or specify a new set of stable addresses.  All PATCH requests take the parameters\
        \ that are to be updated in the request body. If the generate_passphrase is\
        \ 'true', the passphrase is returned in the PATCH response.\n### Fields overview\n\
        This sections highlights the parameters that control the modification of an\
        \ existing cluster peering relationship.\n#### Required fields\nA PATCH request\
        \ with an empty body has no effect on the cluster peer instance. All other\
        \ fields and the combinations in which they are valid are indicated below:\n\
        * `encryption_proposed` - Toggle the proposed encryption protocol (from 'none'\
        \ to 'tls-psk' or otherwise). Authentication must be true and a passphrase\
        \ must be present in body.\n* `passphrase`\n* `passphrase` or `generate passphrase`\n\
        * `remote.ip_addresses`\n#### Optional fields\n* `expiration time` - Set the\
        \ expiration time of the passphrase\n##### Examples\n```\n# Update with an\
        \ empty body\nbody = {}\n# Update the proposed encryption protocol from tls-psk\
        \ to none\nbody =\n{\n    \"authentication\":\n      {\n          \"passphrase\"\
        :\"xyz12345\",\n          \"in_use\":\"ok\"\n      },\n    \"encryption\"\
        :\n      {\n          \"proposed\":\"none\"\n      }\n}\n# Update the passphrase\n\
        body =\n{\n    \"authentication\":\n     {\n         \"passphrase\":\"xyz12345\"\
        ,\n         \"in_use\":\"ok\"\n     }\n}\n# Set an auto-generated passphrase\n\
        body =\n{\n    \"authentication\":\n     {\n         \"generate_passphrase\"\
        : true,\n         \"in_use\":\"ok\"\n     }\n}\n# Update remote IP addresses\n\
        body =\n{\n    \"remote\":\n      {\n          \"ip_addresses\":[\"10.224.65.30\"\
        ]\n      }\n}\n```\n##### Sample requests\n```\n# Set a passphrase\ncurl -X\
        \ PATCH 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/peers/73123071-d0b9-11e8-a686-005056a7179a'\
        \ -d '{\"authentication\":{\"passphrase\":\"xyz12345\",\"in_use\":\"ok\"}}'\n\
        # Update a peer address\ncurl -X PATCH 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/peers/73123071-d0b9-11e8-a686-005056a7179a'\
        \ -d '{\"remote\":{\"ip_addresses\":[\"1.2.3.4\"]}}'\n```\n## Delete a cluster\
        \ peer\nThis interface allows you to delete a cluster peer using the HTTP\
        \ DELETE request.\n#### Required fields\nAll delete operations must be performed\
        \ on a valid peer UUID. Deleting an invalid peer returns 'HTTP 404' indicating\
        \ an error.\n#### Optional fields\nThe DELETE operation has no optional fields.\n\
        #### Request format\nDELETE \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/peers/{uuid}\"\
        \n##### Examples\nThe request -\n```\ncurl -X DELETE \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/peers/8becc0d4-c12c-11e8-9ceb-005056bbd143\"\
        \n```\ndeletes a peer with peer UUID '8becc0d4-c12c-11e8-9ceb-005056bbd143'\n"

        \n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n## Creating a job schedule\nA job schedule is created\
        \ by issuing a POST request to /cluster/schedules to a node in the cluster.\
        \ For a successful request, the POST request returns a status code of 201.\n\
        Job schedules can be of either type \"cron\" or type \"interval\". A cron\
        \ schedule is run at specific minutes within the hour, or hours of the day,\
        \ days of the week, days of the month, or months of the year. An interval\
        \ schedule runs repeatedly at fixed intervals.\n### Required fields\n* name\
        \ - Name of the job schedule\nYou are required to provide a \"minutes\" field\
        \ for a cron schedule. An \"interval\" field is required for an interval schedule.\
        \ You must not provide both a \"cron\" field and an \"interval\" field.\n\
        The schedule UUID is created by the system.\n### Cron schedule fields\n* cron.minutes\
        \ - Minutes within the hour (0 through 59)\n* cron.hours -  Hours of the day\
        \ (0 through 23)\n* cron.weekdays - Weekdays (0 through 6, where 0 is Sunday\
        \ and 6 is Saturday.)\n* cron.days - Days of the month (1 through 31)\n* cron.months\
        \ - Months of the year (1 through 12)\n### Interval schedule field\n* interval\
        \ - Length of time in ISO 8601 duration format\n## Example\n```\n# The API:\n\
        /api/cluster/schedules\n# The call:\ncurl -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/schedules\"\
        \ -d body\n# The response of a successful POST is empty.\nExample body to\
        \ create an interval schedule with a 1-week interval:\n{\n    \"name\": \"\
        test_interval_1\",\n    \"interval\": \"P1W\"\n}\nExample body to create a\
        \ cron schedule that runs daily at 12:05 :\n{\n    \"name\": \"test_cron_1\"\
        ,\n    \"cron\":\n    {\n        \"minutes\": [ 5 ],\n        \"hours\": [\
        \ 12 ]\n    }\n}\n```\n### Optional fields\nBy default, the schedule is owned\
        \ by the local cluster. In a MetroCluster configuration, the partner cluster\
        \ can be specified if the local cluster is in the switchover state.\n* cluster.name\
        \ - Name of the cluster owning the schedule\n* cluster.uuid - UUID of the\
        \ cluster owning the schedule\n### Records field\nMultiple schedules can be\
        \ created in one request by providing an array of named records with schedule\
        \ entries. Each entry must follow the required and optional fields listed\
        \ above.\n## Updating a job schedule\nThe following fields of an existing\
        \ schedule can be modified:\n* cron.minutes\n* cron.hours\n* cron.weekdays\n\
        * cron.days\n* cron.months\n* interval\nNote: The name, cluster, and type\
        \ of schedule cannot be modified. Also, you cannot modify a cron field of\
        \ an interval schedule, or the interval field of a cron schedule. Queries\
        \ on fields can be applied to modify all schedules that match the combined\
        \ query.\n## Example\n```\n# The API:\n/api/cluster/schedules/{uuid}\n# The\
        \ call:\ncurl  -X PATCH \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/schedules/{uuid}\"\
        \ -d body\n# The response of a sucessful PATCH is empty.\nExample body to\
        \ modify an interval schedule with a 2-day and 5-minute interval:\n{\n   \
        \ \"interval\": \"P2DT5M\"\n}\nExample body to modify a cron schedule to run\
        \ Mondays at 2:\n{\n    \"cron\":\n    {\n        \"hours\": [ 2 ],\n    \
        \    \"weekdays\": [ 1 ]\n    }\n}\n```\n## Deleting a job schedule\nJob schedules\
        \ can be deleted based on their UUID. Queries on fields can be applied to\
        \ delete all schedules that match the combined query.\n## Example\n```\n#\
        \ The API:\n/api/cluster/schedules/{uuid}\n# The call:\ncurl -X DELETE \"\
        https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/schedules/{uuid}\"\n# The response of a successful\
        \ DELETE of one schedule is empty.\n```\n```\n# The API:\n/api/cluster/schedules/\n\
        # The call:\ncurl -X DELETE \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/cluster/schedules/?name=test*\"\
        \n# The response of a successful DELETE indicates the number of schedules\
        \ affected:\n{\n  \"num_records\": 2,\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n\
        \      \"href\": \"/api/cluster/schedules?name=test*\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\
        ## MetroCluster configurations\nIn a MetroCluster configuration, user-created\
        \ schedules owned by the local cluster are replicated to the partner cluster.\
        \ Likewise, user-created schedules owned by the partner cluster are replicated\
        \ to the local cluster. The owning cluster for a particular schedule is shown\
        \ in the \"cluster.name\" and \"cluster.uuid\" fields.\nNormally, only schedules\
        \ owned by the local cluster can be created, modified, and deleted on the\
        \ local cluster. However, when a MetroCluster configuration is in switchover,\
        \ the cluster in switchover state can create, modify, and delete schedules\
        \ owned by the partner cluster.\n"

        \ shows how to upgrade cluster software. Setting the `version` field triggers\
        \ the installation of the package. The client can select the `validate_only`\
        \ field to validate the package before the installation starts. Setting `skip_warning`\
        \ as `true` ignores the validation warning before the installation starts.\
        \ Setting the `action` field performs a `pause`, `resume`, or `cancel' to\
        \ an ongoing upgrade. An upgrade can only be resumed if it is in the paused\
        \ state.\n<br/>The client can start the upgrade process at the cluster-level.\
        \ There are no options available to start the upgrade for a specific node\
        \ or HA pairs.\n---\n#### 1. Validating the package and verifying the validation\
        \ results\nThe following example shows how to validate a cluster software\

      description: "## Overview\nName mapping is used to map CIFS identities to UNIX\
        \ identities, Kerberos identities to UNIX identities, and UNIX identities\
        \ to CIFS identities. It needs this information to obtain user credentials\
        \ and provide proper file access regardless of whether they are connecting\
        \ from an NFS client or a CIFS client. </br>\nThe system keeps a set of conversion\
        \ rules for each Storage Virtual Machine (SVM). Each rule consists of two\
        \ pieces: a pattern and a replacement. Conversions start at the beginning\
        \ of the appropriate list and perform a substitution based on the first matching\
        \ rule. The pattern is a UNIX-style regular expression. The replacement is\
        \ a string containing escape sequences representing subexpressions from the\
        \ pattern, as in the UNIX sed program.</br>\nName mappings are applied in\
        \ the order in which they occur in the priority list; for example, a name\
        \ mapping that occurs at position 2 in the priority list is applied before\
        \ a name mapping that occurs at position 3. Each mapping direction (Kerberos-to-UNIX,\
        \ Windows-to-UNIX, and UNIX-to-Windows) has its own priority list. You are\
        \ prevented from creating two name mappings with the same pattern.<p/>\n##\

      description: "## Overview\nA broadcast domain is a collection of Ethernet ports\
        \ that have layer2 connectivity. They are used to determine which Ethernet\
        \ ports can host interfaces of various types. The broadcast domain REST API\
        \ allows you to retrieve, create, modify, and delete broadcast domains. The\
        \ broadcast domain APIs do not manage port membership.  To add a port to a\
        \ broadcast domain or to move a port to a different broadcast domain, use\

        ---\n## Example\n### Creating a new broadcast domain\nThe following example\
        \ shows how to create a broadcast domain with a name of 'bd1' and an MTU of\
        \ 1500.\n<br/>\n---\n```\n# The API:\n/api/network/ethernet/broadcast-domains\n\
        # The call:\ncurl -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/network/ethernet/broadcast-domains?return_records=true\"\
        \ -H \"accept: application/hal+json\" -d '{ \"name\": \"bd1\", \"mtu\": 1500\
        \ }'\n# The response:\n{\n  \"num_records\": 1,\n  \"records\": [\n    {\n\
        \      \"name\": \"bd1\",\n      \"mtu\": 1500,\n      \"_links\": {\n   \
        \     \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/network/ethernet/broadcast-domains/\"\
        \n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n---\n## Updating network Ethernet\
        \ broadcast domains\nThe broadcast domain PATCH API is used to update attributes\
        \ of broadcast domains.\n<br/>\n---\n## Example\n### Updating the name and\
        \ MTU of a specific broadcast domain\nThe following example shows how the\
        \ PATCH request changes the broadcast domain name to 'bd2' and the broadcast\
        \ domain MTU to 9000.\n<br/>\n---\n```\n# The API:\n/api/network/ethernet/broadcast-domains/{uuid}\n\
        # The call:\ncurl -X PATCH \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/network/ethernet/broadcast-domains/6cde03b2-f8a2-11e8-8d33-005056bb986f/\"\
        \ -d '{ \"name\": \"bd2\", \"mtu\": 9000 }'\n{\n}\n```\n---\n## Deleting network\
        \ Ethernet broadcast domains\nThe broadcast domain DELETE API is used to delete\
        \ a broadcast domain from the cluster configuration.\n## Example\n### Deleting\
        \ a specific broadcast domain\nThe following DELETE request deletes a broadcast\
        \ domain.\n<br/>\n---\n```\n# The API:\n/api/network/ethernet/broadcast-domains/{uuid}\n\
        # The call:\ncurl -X DELETE \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/network/ethernet/broadcast-domains/6cde03b2-f8a2-11e8-8d33-005056bb986f/\"\

        \ or specifically requested ports. The fields returned in the response vary\
        \ for different ports and configurations.\n## Examples\n### Retrieving all\
        \ ports in the cluster\nThe following output displays the UUID, name, and\
        \ port type for all ports configured in a 2-node cluster. The port types are\
        \ physical, vlan, and lag (ifgrp).\n<br/>\n---\n```\n# The API:\n/api/network/ethernet/ports\n\

        ## Updating ports\nThe network ports PATCH API is used to modify attributes\
        \ of ports.\n<br/>\n---\n## Examples\n### Updating the broadcast domain of\
        \ a port\nThe following PATCH request removes the port from the current broadcast\
        \ domain and adds it to the specified broadcast domain.\n<br/>\n---\n```\n\
        # The API:\n/api/network/ethernet/ports/{uuid}\n# The call:\ncurl -X PATCH\
        \ \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/network/ethernet/ports/6867efaf-d702-11e8-994f-005056bbc994\"\
        \ -H  \"accept: application/hal+json\" -H  \"Content-Type: application/json\"\
        \ -d \"{ \\\"broadcast_domain\\\": { \\\"name\\\": \\\"Default\\\", \\\"ipspace\\\
        \": { \\\"name\\\": \\\"Default\\\" }}}\"\n```\n---\n### Updating the admin\
        \ status of a port\nThe following PATCH request brings the specified port\
        \ down.\n<br/>\n---\n```\n# The API:\n/api/network/ethernet/ports/{uuid}\n\
        # The call:\ncurl -X PATCH \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/network/ethernet/ports/51d3ab39-d86d-11e8-aca6-005056bbc994\"\
        \ -H  \"accept: application/hal+json\" -H  \"Content-Type: application/json\"\
        \ -d \"{ \\\"enabled\\\": \\\"false\\\" }\"\n```\n---\n## Deleting ports\n\
        The network ports DELETE API is used to delete VLAN and LAG ports in the cluster.\
        \ Note that physical ports cannot be deleted.\nDeleting a port also removes\
        \ the port from the broadcast domain.\n---\n## Example\n### Deleting a VLAN\
        \ port\nThe network ports DELETE API is used to delete a VLAN port.\n<br/>\n\
        ---\n```\n# The API:\n/api/network/ethernet/ports/{uuid}\n# The call:\ncurl\
        \ -X DELETE \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/network/ethernet/ports/6867efaf-d702-11e8-994f-005056bbc994\"\
        \ -H  \"accept: application/hal+json\" -H  \"Content-Type: application/json\"\

      description: "## Overview\nFibre Channel (FC) interfaces are the logical endpoints\
        \ for FC network connections to an SVM. An FC interface provides FC access\
        \ to storage within the interface SVM using either Fibre Channel Protocol\
        \ or NVMe over FC (NVMe/FC).<br/>\nThe Fibre Channel interface REST API allows\
        \ you to create, delete, update, and discover FC interfaces, and obtain status\
        \ information for FC interfaces.<br/>\nAn FC interface is created on an FC\
        \ port which is located on a cluster node. The FC port must be specified to\
        \ identify the location of the interface for a POST or PATCH request that\
        \ relocates an interface. You can identify the port by supplying either the\
        \ node and port names or the port UUID.\n## Examples\n### Creating an FC interface\

        \ properties or deleting an FC interface, the interface must first be disabled\
        \ using the following:\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPATCH /api/network/fc/interfaces/{uuid}\n\
        # The call:\ncurl -X PATCH 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/network/fc/interfaces/f6045b92-dec7-11e8-a733-005056bba0e0'\
        \ -H 'accept: application/hal+json' -d '{ \"enabled\": false }'\n```\n---\n\
        ### Moving the FC interface to a new node and port\nTo move an FC interface\
        \ to another node or port, the destination FC port must be specified in a\
        \ PATCH request. Either the port UUID or node and port names can be used to\
        \ identify the port.<br/>\nNote that only FC interfaces configured for the\
        \ FC Protocol can be moved. FC interfaces configured for NVMe/FC cannot be\
        \ moved. The interface must also be set to the disabled state before being\
        \ moved.\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPATCH /api/network/fc/interfaces/{uuid}\n\
        # The call:\ncurl -X PATCH 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/network/fc/interfaces/f6045b92-dec7-11e8-a733-005056bba0e0'\

        : \"a1dc7aa5-db83-11e8-9ef7-005056bbbbcc\" } } }'\n```\n---\n### Deleting\
        \ an FC interface\nAn FC interface must be disabled before being deleted.\n\
        <br/>\n```\n# The API:\nDELETE /api/network/fc/interfaces/{uuid}\n# The call:\n\
        curl -X DELETE 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/network/fc/interfaces/f6045b92-dec7-11e8-a733-005056bba0e0'\

      description: "## Overview\nA world wide port name (WWPN) is a unique 64-bit\
        \ identifier for a Fibre Channel (FC) initiator. It is displayed as a 16-character\
        \ hexadecimal value. SAN administrators may find it easier to identify FC\
        \ initiators using an alias, especially in larger SANs.<br/>\nThe WWPN alias\
        \ REST API allows you to create, delete, and discover aliases for WWPNs.<br/>\n\
        Multiple aliases can be created for a WWPN, but you cannot use the same alias\
        \ for multiple WWPNs.<br/>\nAn alias can consist of up to 32 characters. Valid\
        \ characters are:\n* A through Z\n* a through z\n* numbers 0 through 9\n*\
        \ hyphen (\"-\")\n* underscore (\"_\")\n* left and right braces (\"{\", \"\
        }\")\n* period (\".\")\n## Examples\n### Creating a WWPN alias\n```\n# The\
        \ API:\nPOST /api/network/fc/wwpn-aliases\n# The call:\ncurl -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/network/fc/wwpn-aliases\"\

      description: "## Overview\nAn IPspace is an addressing domain within which each\
        \ IP address is unique.  The same address may appear in a different IPspace,\
        \ but the matching addresses are considered to be distinct. SVMs and broadcast\
        \ domains, and therefore IP interfaces and Ethernet ports, are associated\
        \ with a single IPspace. This endpoint supports the following operations:\
        \ GET (collection and instance), POST, PATCH, and DELETE.\n## Retrieving IPspace\
        \ information\nThe IPspaces GET API retrieves all IPspaces configured in the\
        \ cluster, including built-in and custom IPspaces, and specifically requested\
        \ IPspaces.\n## Examples\n### Retrieving a list of the IPspaces in the cluster\n\
        The following example returns the requested list of IPspaces configured in\
        \ the cluster.\n```\n# The API:\n/api/network/ipspaces\n# The call:\ncurl\
        \ -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/network/ipspaces?fields=*\" -H \"accept:\
        \ application/hal+json\"\n# The response:\n{\n  \"records\": [\n    {\n  \

        \ \"Default\",\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\"\
        : \"/api/network/ipspaces/dcc7e79c-5acc-11e8-b9de-005056b42b32\"\n       \
        \ }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"uuid\": \"dfd3c1b2-5acc-11e8-b9de-005056b42b32\"\

        \    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/network/ipspaces?fields=*\"\n   \
        \ }\n  }\n}\n```\n---\n### Retrieving a specific IPspace in the cluster\n\
        The following example returns the specific IPspace requested. The system returns\
        \ an error if there is no IPspace with the requested UUID.\n<br/>\n---\n```\n\
        # The API:\n/api/network/ipspaces/{uuid}\n# The call:\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/network/ipspaces/dfd3c1b2-5acc-11e8-b9de-005056b42b32?fields=*\"\
        \ -H \"accept: application/hal+json\"\n# The response:\n  {\n    \"uuid\"\
        : \"dcc7e79c-5acc-11e8-b9de-005056b42b32\",\n    \"name\": \"Default\",\n\

        \n      }\n    }\n  }\n```\n---\n## Creating IPspaces\nThe network IPspaces\
        \ POST API is used to create IPspaces.\n<br/>\n---\n## Example\n### Creating\
        \ an IPspace\nThe following output displays the record returned after the\
        \ creation of an IPspace with the name \"ipspace1\".\n<br/>\n---\n```\n# The\
        \ API:\n/api/network/ipspaces\n# The call:\ncurl -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/network/ipspaces?return_records=true\"\
        \ -H  \"accept: application/hal+json\" -d \"{  \\\"name\\\": \\\"ipspace2\\\
        \"}\"\n# The response:\n{\n  \"num_records\": 1,\n  \"records\": [\n    {\n\
        \      \"uuid\": \"4165655e-0528-11e9-bd68-005056bb046a\",\n      \"name\"\

        \ }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n---\n## Updating IPspaces\nThe IPspaces\
        \ PATCH API is used to modify attributes of the IPspace.\n<br/>\n---\n## Example\n\
        ### Updating the name of an IPspace\nThe following PATCH request is used to\
        \ update the name of the IPspace from \"ipspace2\" to \"ipspace20\".\n<br/>\n\
        ---\n```\n# The API:\n/api/network/ipspaces/{uuid}\n# The call:\ncurl -X PATCH\
        \ \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/network/ipspaces/4165655e-0528-11e9-bd68-005056bb046a\"\
        \ -H  \"accept: application/hal+json\" -d \"{  \\\"name\\\": \\\"ipspace20\\\
        \"}\"\n```\n---\n## Deleting IPspaces\nThe IPspaces DELETE API is used to\
        \ delete an IPspace.\n<br/>\n---\n## Example\n### Deleting an IPspace\nThe\
        \ following DELETE request is used to delete an IPspace.\n<br/>\n---\n```\n\
        # The API:\n/api/network/ipspaces/{uuid}\n# The call:\ncurl -X DELETE \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/network/ipspaces/4165655e-0528-11e9-bd68-005056bb046a\"\

      description: "## Overview\nONTAP home directory functionality can be used to\
        \ create home directories for SMB users on the CIFS server and automatically\
        \ offer each user a dynamic share to their home directory without creating\
        \ an individual SMB share for each user.<p/>\nThe home directory search path\
        \ is a set of absolute paths from the root of an SVM that directs ONTAP to\
        \ search for home directories. If there are multiple search paths, ONTAP tries\
        \ them in the order specified until it finds a valid path. To use the CIFS\
        \ home directories feature, at least one home directory search path must be\
        \ added for an SVM. <p/>\n## Examples\n### Creating a home directory search\
        \ path\nTo create a home directory search path, use the following API. Note\
        \ the <i>return_records=true</i> query parameter used to obtain the newly\
        \ created entry in the response.\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPOST /api/protocols/cifs/home-directory/search-paths\n\
        # The call:\ncurl -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/protocols/cifs/home-directory/search-paths?return_records=true\"\
        \ -H \"accept: applicaion/json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d\
        \ \"{ \\\"path\\\": \\\"/\\\", \\\"svm\\\": { \\\"name\\\": \\\"vs1\\\", \\\
        \"uuid\\\": \\\"a41fd873-ecf8-11e8-899d-0050568e9333\\\" }}\"\n# The response:\n\
        {\n  \"num_records\": 1,\n  \"records\": [\n    {\n      \"svm\": {\n    \
        \    \"uuid\": \"a41fd873-ecf8-11e8-899d-0050568e9333\",\n        \"name\"\
        : \"vs1\"\n      },\n    \"path\": \"/\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n---\n### Retrieving\
        \ the CIFS home directory search paths configuration for all SVMs in the cluster\n\
        ```\n# The API:\nGET /protocols/cifs/home-directory/search-paths\n# The call:\n\
        curl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/protocols/cifs/home-directory/search-paths?fields=*&return_records=true&return_timeout=15\"\
        \ -H \"accept: application/json\"\n# The response:\n{\n  \"records\": [\n\
        \    {\n      \"svm\": {\n        \"uuid\": \"2d96f9aa-f4ce-11e8-b075-0050568e278e\"\
        ,\n        \"name\": \"vs1\"\n      },\n      \"index\": 1,\n      \"path\"\
        : \"/\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"svm\": {\n        \"uuid\": \"2d96f9aa-f4ce-11e8-b075-0050568e278e\"\
        ,\n        \"name\": \"vs1\"\n      },\n        \"index\": 2,\n        \"\
        path\": \"/a\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"svm\": {\n        \"uuid\": \"4f23449b-f4ce-11e8-b075-0050568e278e\"\
        ,\n        \"name\": \"vs2\"\n      },\n      \"index\": 1,\n      \"path\"\

        : \"/1\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"num_records\": 4\n}\n```\n### Retrieving a specific\
        \ home directory searchpath configuration for an SVM\nThe configuration returned\
        \ is identified by the UUID of its SVM and the index (position) in the list\
        \ of search paths that is searched to  find a home directory of a user. <br/>\n\
        ```\n# The API:\nGET /api/protocols/home-directory/search-paths/{svm.uuid}/{index}\n\
        # The call:\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/protocols/cifs/home-directory/search-paths/2d96f9aa-f4ce-11e8-b075-0050568e278e/2\"\
        \ -H \"accept: application/json\"\n# The response:\n{\n  \"svm\": {\n    \"\
        uuid\": \"2d96f9aa-f4ce-11e8-b075-0050568e278e\",\n    \"name\": \"vs1\"\n\
        \  },\n  \"index\": 2,\n  \"path\": \"/a\"\n}\n```\n### Reordering a specific\
        \ home drectory search path in the list\nAn entry in the home directory search\
        \ path list can be reordered to a new positin by specifying the 'new_index'\
        \ field. The reordered configuration is identified by the UUID of its SVM\
        \ and the index. <br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPATCH /api/protocols/cifs/home-directory/search-paths/{svm.uuid}/{index}\n\
        # The call:\ncurl -X PATCH \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/protocols/cifs/home-directory/search-paths/2d96f9aa-f4ce-11e8-b075-0050568e278e/2?new_index=1\"\
        \ -H \"accept: application/json\"\n```\n### Removing a specific home directory\
        \ search path for an SVM\nThe entry being removed is identified by the UUID\
        \ of its SVM and the index. <br/>\n```\n# The API:\nDELETE /api/protocols/cifs/home-directory/search-paths/{svm.uuid}/{index}\n\
        # The call:\ncurl -X DELETE \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/protocols/cifs/home-directory/search-paths/2d96f9aa-f4ce-11e8-b075-0050568e278e/2\"\

      description: "## Overview\nA CIFS server is necessary to provide SMB clients\
        \ with access to the Storage Virtual Machine (SVM). Before you begin, the\
        \ following prerequisites must be in place:</br>\n * At least one SVM LIF\
        \ must exist on the SVM.\n * The LIFs must be able to connect to the DNS servers\
        \ configured on the SVM and to an Active Directory domain controller of the\
        \ domain to which you want to join the CIFS server.\n * The DNS servers must\
        \ contain the service location records that are needed to locate the Active\
        \ Directory domain services.\n * The cluster time must be synchronized to\
        \ within five minutes of the Active Directory domain controller.\n### Information\
        \ on the CIFS server\n You must keep the following in mind when creating the\
        \ CIFS server:\n * The CIFS server name might or might not be the same as\
        \ the SVM name.\n * The CIFS server name can be up to 15 characters in length.\n\
        \ * The following characters are not allowed: @ # * ( ) = + [ ] | ; : \" ,\
        \ < > \\ / ?\n * You must use the FQDN when specifying the domain.\n * The\
        \ default is to add the CIFS server machine account to the Active Directory\
        \ \"CN=Computer\" object.\n * You can choose to add the CIFS server to a different\
        \ organizational unit (OU) by specifying the \"organizational_unit\" parameter.\
        \ When specifying the OU, do not specify the domain portion of the distinguished\
        \ name; only specify the OU or CN portion of the distinguished name. ONTAP\
        \ appends the value provided for the required \"-domain\" parameter onto the\
        \ value provided for the \"-ou\" parameter to create the Active Directory\
        \ distinguished name, which is used when joining the Active Directory domain.\n\
        \ * You can optionally choose to add a text comment of up to 48 characters\
        \ about the CIFS server. If there is a space in the comment text, you must\
        \ enclose the entire string in quotation marks.\n * You can optionally choose\
        \ to add a comma-delimited list of one or more NetBIOS aliases for the CIFS\
        \ server.\n * The initial administrative status of the CIFS server is \"up\"\
        .\n * The <i> large-mtu</i> and <i>multichannel</i> features are enabled for\
        \ the new CIFS server.\n * If LDAP is configured with the <i>use_start_tls</i>\
        \ and <i>session_security</i> features, the new CIFS server will also have\
        \ this property set.\n## Examples\n### Creating a CIFS server\nTo create a\
        \ CIFS server, use the following API. Note the <i>return_records=true</i>\
        \ query parameter used to obtain the newly created entry in the response.\n\

      description: "## Overview\nBefore any users or applications can access data\
        \ on the CIFS server over SMB, a CIFS share must be created with sufficient\
        \ share permissions. CIFS share is a named access point in a volume which\
        \ is tied to the CIFS server on the SVM. Before creating a CIFS share make\
        \ sure that the path is valid within the scope of the SVM and that it is reachable.</br>\n\
        Permissions can be assigned to this newly created share by specifying the\
        \ 'acls' field. When a CIFS share is created, ONTAP creates a default ACL\
        \ for this share with 'Full-Control' permissions for an 'Everyone' user.\n\

      description: "## Overview\nAccess to files and folders can be secured over a\
        \ network by configuring share access control lists (ACLs) on CIFS shares.\
        \ Share-level ACLs can be configured by using either Windows users and groups\
        \ or UNIX users and groups. A share-level ACL consists of a list of access\
        \ control entries (ACEs). Each ACE contains a user or group name and a set\
        \ of permissions that determines user or group access to the share, regardless\
        \ of the security style of the volume or qtree containing the share. </br>\n\
        When an SMB user tries to access a share, ONTAP checks the share-level ACL\
        \ to determine whether access should be granted. A share-level ACL only restricts\
        \ access to files in the share; it never grants more access than the file\
        \ level ACLs.\n## Examples\n### Creating a CIFS share ACL\nTo create a share\
        \ ACL for a CIFS share, use the following API. Note the <i>return_records=true</i>\
        \ query parameter used to obtain the newly created entry in the response.\n\
        <br/>\n---\n```\n# The API:\nPOST /api/protocols/cifs/shares{svm.uuid}/{share}/acls\n\
        # The call:\ncurl -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/protocols/cifs/shares/000c5cd2-ebdf-11e8-a96e-0050568ea3cb/sh1/acls?return_records=true\"\

        \ \"{ \\\"permission\\\": \\\"no_access\\\", \\\"type\\\": \\\"windows\\\"\

        ,\n      \"permission\": \"no_access\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n---\n### Retrieving\
        \ all CIFS shares ACLs for a specific CIFS share for a specific SVM in the\
        \ cluster\n---\n```\n# The API:\nGET /api/protocols/cifs/shares/{svm.uuid}/{share}/acls\n\

      description: "## Overview\nONTAP allows both CIFS and NFS to access the same\
        \ datastore. This datastore can contain symbolic links which are files, created\
        \ by UNIX clients. It contains a reference to another file or directory. If\
        \ an SMB client accesses a symbolic link, it is redirected to the target file\
        \ or directory that the symbolic link refers to. The symbolic links can point\
        \ to files within the volume that contain the share, or to files that are\
        \ contained in other volumes on the Storage Virtual Machine (SVM), or even\
        \ to volumes contained on other SVMs.<p/>\nThere are two types of symbolic\
        \ links:\n  * <b>Relative</b>  A relative symbolic link contains a reference\
        \ to the file or directory relative to its parent directory. Therefore, the\
        \ path of the file it is referring to should not begin with a backslash (/).\
        \ If you enable symbolic links on a share, relative symbolic links work without\
        \ UNIX symlink mapping.\n  * <b>Absolute</b> An absolute symbolic link contains\
        \ a reference to a file or directory in the form of an absolute path. Therefore,\
        \ the path of the file it is referring to should begin with a backslash (/).\
        \ An absolute symbolic link can refer to a file or directory within or outside\
        \ of the file system of the symbolic link. If the target is not in the same\
        \ local file system, the symbolic link is called a \"widelink\". If the symbolic\
        \ link is enabled on a share and absolute symbolic links do not work right\
        \ away, the mapping between the UNIX path of the symbolic link to the destination\
        \ CIFS path must be created. When creating absolute symbolic link mappings,\
        \ locality could be either \"local\" or \"widelink\" and it must be specified.\
        \ If UNIX symlink mapping is created for a file or directory which is outside\
        \ of the local share but the locality is set to \"local\", ONTAP does not\
        \ allow access to the target.\n</br>A UNIX symbolic link support could be\
        \ added to SMB shares by specifying the <i>unix_symlink</i> property during\
        \ the creation of SMB shares or at any time by modifying the existing SMB\
        \ <i>unix_symlink</i> property. UNIX symbolic link support is enabled by default.<p/>\n\
        ## Examples\n### Creating a UNIX symlink mapping for CIFS shares\nTo create\
        \ UNIX symlink mappings for SMB shares, use the following API. Note the <i>return_records=true</i>\

      description: "## Overview\nFPolicy is an infrastructure component of ONTAP that\
        \ enables partner applications to connect to ONTAP in order to monitor and\
        \ set file access permissions. Every time a client accesses a file from a\
        \ storage system, based on the configuration of FPolicy, the partner application\
        \ is notified about file access. This enables partners to set restrictions\
        \ on files that are created or accessed on the storage system. FPolicy also\
        \ allows you to create file policies that specify file operation permissions\
        \ according to file type. For example, you can restrict certain file types,\
        \ such as .jpeg and .mp3 files, from being stored on the storage system. FPolicy\
        \ can monitor file access from CIFS and NFS clients.</br>\nAs part of FPolicy\
        \ configuration, you can specify an FPolicy engine which defines the external\
        \ FPolicy server, FPolicy events, which defines the protocol and file operations\
        \ to monitor and the FPolicy policy that acts as a container for the FPolicy\
        \ engine and FPolicy events. It provides a way for policy management functions,\
        \ such as policy enabling and disabling.\n## Examples\n### Creating an FPolicy\
        \ configuration\nTo create an FPolicy for an SVM use the following API. Note\

        \ servers to which the file access notifications are sent. As part of FPolicy\
        \ engine configuration, you can configure the server(s) to which the notification\
        \ is sent, an optional set of secondary server(s) to which the notification\
        \ is sent in the case of the primary server(s) failure, the port number for\
        \ FPolicy application and the type of the engine, synchronous or asynchronous.\
        \ </br>\nFor the synchronous engine, ONTAP will wait for a response from the\
        \ FPolicy application before it allows the operation. With an asynchronous\
        \ engine, ONTAP proceeds with the operation processing after sending the notification\
        \ to the FPolicy application. An engine can belong to multiple FPolicy policies.\n\

      description: "## Overview\nFPolicy events configurations allow you to specify\
        \ which file access is monitored. As part of an FPolicy event, you can configure\
        \ the SVM for which the events are generated, the name of the event configuration,\
        \ the protocol (cifs, nfsv3/nfsv4) for which the events are generated, the\
        \ file operations which are monitored, and filters that can be used to filter\
        \ the unwanted notification generation for a specified protocol and file operation.</br>\n\
        Each protocol has a set of supported file operations and filters. An SVM can\

      description: "## Overview\nThe FPolicy policy acts as a container for different\
        \ constituents of the FPolicy such as FPolicy events and the FPolicy engine.\
        \ It also provides a platform for policy management functions, such as policy\
        \ enabling and disabling. As part of FPolicy policy configuration, you can\
        \ specifiy the name of policy, the SVM to which it belongs, the FPolicy events\
        \ to monitor, the FPolicy engine to which the generated notifications are\
        \ sent and the policy priority. FPolicy policy configuration also allows to\
        \ you to configure the file access behaviour when the primary and secondary\
        \ servers are down. Under such circumstances, if the \"mandatory\" field is\
        \ set to true, file access is denied.</br>\nEach FPolicy policy is associated\
        \ with a scope which allows you to restrain the scope of the policy to specified\
        \ storage objects such as volume, shares and export or to a set of file extensions\
        \ such as .txt, .jpeg. An FPolicy policy can be configured to send notifications,\
        \ to the FPolicy server or for native file blocking which uses the file extension\
        \ specified in the policy scope. An SVM can have multiple FPolicy policies\
        \ which can be enabled or disabled independently of each other.\n## Examples\n\

        \ most one NVMe service for an SVM. An SVM's NVMe service must be created\
        \ before NVMe host initiators can connect to the SVM.<br/>\nThe Non-Volatile\
        \ Memory Express (NVMe) service REST API allows you to create, update, delete,\
        \ and discover NVMe services for SVMs.\n## Examples\n### Creating an NVMe\
        \ service for an SVM\nThe simpliest way to create an NVMe service is to specify\
        \ only the SVM, either by name or UUID. By default, the new NVMe service is\
        \ enabled.<br/>\nIn this example, the `return_records` query parameter is\
        \ used to retrieve the new NVMe service object in the REST response.\n<br/>\n\
        ```\n# The API:\nPOST /api/protocols/nvme/services\n# The call:\ncurl -X POST\
        \ 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/protocols/nvme/services?return_records=true' -H 'accept:\
        \ application/hal+json' -d '{ \"svm\": { \"name\": \"svm1\" } }'\n# The response:\n\
        {\n  \"num_records\": 1,\n  \"records\": [\n    {\n      \"svm\": {\n    \
        \    \"uuid\": \"bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341\",\n        \"name\"\
        : \"svm1\",\n        \"_links\": {\n          \"self\": {\n            \"\
        href\": \"/api/svm/svms/bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341\"\n         \
        \ }\n        }\n      },\n      \"enabled\": true,\n      \"_links\": {\n\
        \        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/protocols/nvme/services/bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341\"\
        \n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n---\n### Retrieving the NVMe services\
        \ for all SVMs in the cluster\n```\n# The API:\nGET /api/protocols/nvme/services\n\
        # The call:\ncurl -X GET 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/protocols/nvme/services' -H\
        \ 'accept: application/hal+json'\n# The response:\n{\n  \"records\": [\n \
        \   {\n      \"svm\": {\n        \"uuid\": \"ab60c350-dc68-11e8-9711-005056bbe408\"\
        ,\n        \"name\": \"svm0\",\n        \"_links\": {\n          \"self\"\
        : {\n            \"href\": \"/api/svm/svms/ab60c350-dc68-11e8-9711-005056bbe408\"\
        \n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\"\
        : {\n          \"href\": \"/api/protocols/nvme/services/ab60c350-dc68-11e8-9711-005056bbe408\"\
        \n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"svm\": {\n        \"uuid\": \"\
        bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341\",\n        \"name\": \"svm1\",\n   \
        \     \"_links\": {\n          \"self\": {\n            \"href\": \"/api/svm/svms/bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341\"\
        \n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\"\
        : {\n          \"href\": \"/api/protocols/nvme/services/bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341\"\
        \n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"num_records\": 2,\n  \"_links\": {\n\
        \    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/protocols/nvme/services\"\n    }\n\
        \  }\n}\n```\n---\n### Retrieving details for a specific NVMe service\nThe\
        \ NVMe service is identified by the UUID of its SVM.\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\n\
        GET /api/protocols/nvme/services/{svm.uuid}\n# The call:\ncurl -X GET 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/protocols/nvme/services/bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341'\
        \ -H 'accept: application/hal+json'\n# The response:\n{\n  \"svm\": {\n  \
        \  \"uuid\": \"bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341\",\n    \"name\": \"svm1\"\
        ,\n    \"_links\": {\n      \"self\": {\n        \"href\": \"/api/svm/svms/bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341\"\
        \n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"enabled\": true,\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"self\"\
        : {\n      \"href\": \"/api/protocols/nvme/services/bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341\"\
        \n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n---\n### Disabling an NVMe service\nDisabling an NVMe\
        \ service shuts down all active NVMe connections for the SVM and prevents\
        \ the creation of new NVMe connections.<br/>\nThe NVMe service to update is\
        \ identified by the UUID of its SVM.\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPATCH /api/protocols/nvme/services/{svm.uuid}\n\
        # The call:\ncurl -X PATCH 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/protocols/nvme/services/bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341'\
        \ -H 'accept: application/hal+json' -d '{ \"enabled\": \"false\" }'\n```\n\
        <br/>\nYou can retrieve the NVMe service to confirm the change.<br/>\n<br/>\n\
        ```\n# The API:\nGET /api/protocols/nvme/services/{svm.uuid}\n# The call:\n\
        curl -X GET 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/protocols/nvme/services/bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341'\
        \ -H 'accept: application/hal+json'\n# The response:\n{\n  \"svm\": {\n  \
        \  \"uuid\": \"bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341\",\n    \"name\": \"svm1\"\
        ,\n    \"_links\": {\n      \"self\": {\n        \"href\": \"/api/svm/svms/bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341\"\
        \n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"enabled\": false,\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"self\"\
        : {\n      \"href\": \"/api/protocols/nvme/services/bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341\"\
        \n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n---\n### Deleting an NVMe service\nThe NVMe service\
        \ must be disabled before it can be deleted. In addition, all NVMe interfaces,\
        \ subsystems, and subsystem maps associated with the SVM must first be deleted.<br/>\n\
        The NVMe service to delete is identified by the UUID of its SVM.\n<br/>\n\
        ```\n# The API:\nDELETE /api/protocols/nvme/services/{svm.uuid}\n# The call:\n\
        curl -X DELETE 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/protocols/nvme/services/bfb1beb0-dc69-11e8-b29f-005056bb7341'\

      description: "## Overview\nAn NVMe subsystem map is an association of an NVMe\
        \ namespace with an NVMe subsystem. When an NVMe namespace is mapped to an\
        \ NVMe subsystem, the NVMe subsystem's hosts are granted access to the NVMe\
        \ namespace. The relationship between an NVMe subsystem and an NVMe namespace\
        \ is one subsystem to many namespaces.<br/>\nThe NVMe subsystem map REST API\
        \ allows you to create, delete and discover NVMe subsystem maps.\n## Examples\n\
        ### Creating an NVMe subsystem map\n```\n# The API:\nPOST /api/protocols/nvme/subsystem-maps\n\
        # The call:\ncurl -X POST 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/protocols/nvme/subsystem-maps'\
        \ -H 'accept: application/hal+json' -d '{ \"svm\": { \"name\": \"svm1\" },\

      description: "## Overview\nAn initiator group (igroup) is a collection of Fibre\
        \ Channel (FC) world wide port names (WWPNs), and/or iSCSI Qualified Names\
        \ (IQNs), and/or iSCSI EUIs (Extended Unique Identifiers) that identify host\
        \ initiators.<br/>\nInitiator groups are used to control which hosts can access\
        \ specific LUNs. To grant access to a LUN from one or more hosts, create an\
        \ initiator group containing the host initiator names, then create a LUN map\
        \ that associates the initiator group with the LUN.<br/>\nThe initator group\
        \ REST API allows you to create, update, delete, and discover initiator groups,\
        \ and add and remove initiators that can access the target and associated\
        \ LUNs.\nAn initiator can appear in multiple initiator groups. An initiator\
        \ group can be mapped to multiple LUNs. A specific initiator can be mapped\
        \ to a specific LUN only once.<br/>\nAll initiators in an initiator group\
        \ must be from the same operating system. The initiator group's operating\
        \ system is specified when the initiator group is created.<br/>\nWhen an initiator\
        \ group is created, the `protocol` property is used to restrict member initiators\
        \ to Fibre Channel (_fcp_), iSCSI (_iscsi_), or both (_mixed_).<br/>\nZero\
        \ or more initiators can be supplied when the initiator group is created.\
        \ After creation, initiators can be added or removed from the initiator group\
        \ using the `/protocols/san/igroups/{igroup.uuid}/initiators` endpoint. See\
        \ [`POST /protocols/san/igroups/{igroup.uuid}/initiators`](#/SAN/igroup_initiator_create)\
        \ and [`DELETE /protocols/san/igroups/{igroup.uuid}/initiators/{name}`](#/SAN/igroup_initiator_delete)\
        \ for more details.<br/>\nAn FC WWPN consist of 16 hexadecimal digits grouped\
        \ as 8 pairs separated by colons. The format for an iSCSI IQN is _iqn.yyyy-mm.reverse_domain_name:any_.\
        \ The iSCSI EUI format consists of the _eui._ prefix followed by 16 hexadecimal\
        \ characters.\n## Examples\n### Creating an initiator group with no initiators\n\
        The example initiator group is for Linux iSCSI initiators only. Note that\
        \ the `return_records` query parameter is used to obtain the newly created\
        \ initiator group in the response.\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPOST /api/protocols/san/igroups\n\

      description: "## Overview\nAn iSCSI credentials object defines authentication\
        \ credentials to be used between an initiator and ONTAP. It identifies an\
        \ authentication type, user names, and passwords that must be used to authenticate\
        \ a specific initiator.<br/>\nThe iSCSI credentials REST API allows you to\
        \ create, update, delete, and discover iSCSI credentials.<br/>\n## How iSCSI\
        \ authentication works\nAn iSCSI credentials object defines the authentication\
        \ credentials to be used between an initiator and ONTAP. While establishing\
        \ an iSCSI connection, the initiator sends a login request to ONTAP to begin\
        \ an iSCSI session. ONTAP then either permits or denies the login request,\
        \ or determines that a login is not required.<p/>\nFor an initiator, you can\
        \ specify an authentication type, user names and passwords, and a whitelist\
        \ of optional network addresses from which the initiator is allowed to connect.\n\
        ## iSCSI authentication methods\n  - Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol\
        \ (CHAP) - The initiator logs in using a CHAP user name and password. There\
        \ are two types of CHAP user names and passwords:\n    - Inbound - ONTAP authenticates\
        \ the initiator. Inbound settings are required if you are using CHAP authentication.\n\
        \    - Outbound - These are optional credentials to enable the initiator to\
        \ authenticate ONTAP. You can use credentials only if inbound credentials\
        \ are also being used.\n  - deny - The initiator is denied access to ONTAP.\n\
        \  - none - ONTAP does not require authentication for the initiator.\nThe\
        \ CHAP inbound/outbound password can be any valid string or an even number\
        \ of valid hexidecimal digits preceded by '0X' or '0x'.\n## Initiator address\
        \ list\nThe initiator address list is a way to specify valid IP addresses\
        \ from which the initiator is allowed to connect. If the list is specified\
        \ and the source address of an iSCSI connection is not in the list, the connection\
        \ is rejected. Initiator addresses can be specified in either IPv4 or IPv6\
        \ format and in one of two forms:\n- Range\n  ```\n  {\n    \"start\": \"\
        192.168.0.0\",\n    \"end\": \"192.168.0.255\"\n  }\n  ```\n- Mask\n  ```\n\
        \  {\n    \"address\": \"192.168.0.0\",\n    \"netmask\": \"24\"\n  }\n  ```\n\
        ## Initiator \"default\"\nThe default iSCSI authentication definition is created\
        \ when the iSCSI service is created. An iSCSI credentials object with _default_\
        \ as the initiator name identifies the default authentication for an SVM.\
        \ The default credentials are used for any initiator that does not have specific\
        \ iSCSI credentials. The default iSCSI authentication method is _none_, but\
        \ can be changed to _deny_ or _CHAP_. The default credentials object does\
        \ not support an initiator address list.\n## Examples\n### Creating iSCSI\
        \ credentials requiring no authentication\n```\n# The API:\nPOST /api/protocols/san/iscsi/credentials\n\
        # The call:\ncurl -X POST 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/protocols/san/iscsi/credentials'\
        \ -H 'accept: application/hal+json' -d '{ \"svm\": { \"name\": \"svm1\" },\
        \ \"initiator\": \"iqn.1992-08.com.netapp:initiator1\", \"authentication_type\"\
        : \"none\" }'\n```\n---\n### Creating iSCSI credentials using CHAP inbound\
        \ authentication\n```\n# The API:\nPOST /api/protocols/san/iscsi/credentials\n\
        # The call:\ncurl -X POST 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/protocols/san/iscsi/credentials'\
        \ -H 'accept: application/hal+json' -d '{ \"svm\": { \"name\": \"svm1\" },\

        \ by viruses or other malicious code. This combines best-in-class third party\
        \ antivirus software with ONTAP features that give you the flexibility you\
        \ need to control which files get scanned and when. Storage systems offload\
        \ scanning operations to external servers hosting antivirus software from\
        \ third party vendors. An Antivirus Connector on the external server handles\

      description: "## Overview\nVscan On-Demand scanning is used to check files for\
        \ viruses on a schedule. For example, it can be used to run scans only in\
        \ off-peak hours, or to scan very large files that are excluded from an on-access\
        \ scan. Vscan On-Demand scanning can be used for any path in the SVM namespace.<p/>\n\
        Vscan On-Demand policy configurations define the scope of a Vscan On-Demand\
        \ scan. The schedule parameter in the On-Demand policy configuration decides\
        \ when to execute the task. Schedule can be created using the /api/clusters/schedule\
        \ endpoint and can be assigned on policy create or policy modify. This API\

      description: "## Overview\nA valid user account is required to login to and\
        \ provision, monitor, and manage the cluster. The scope of the management\
        \ operation can be at the cluster level or at an individual SVM level. There\
        \ is a need to create user accounts with specific privileges apart from the\
        \ default user accounts, \"admin\", for cluster and \"vsadmin\" for SVM. Custom\
        \ user accounts can be configured to perform specific (scoped) operations.\
        \ User accounts can either be created locally (on the Netapp system) or referenced\
        \ from an external directory server (NIS, LDAP or Active Directory).\nApart\
        \ from creation, modification, and deletion of a user account, locking and\
        \ unlocking of a user account or resetting the password (for local accounts\
        \ only) is possible.<br/>\nA user account must be associated with the following\
        \ before it can become operational:<p/>\n1. A management appplication (SSH,\
        \ HTTP, console, shelf-processor, and such like) for user login. HTTP enables\
        \ REST API access.\n2. Scope - either cluster or SVM.\n3. Authentication source\
        \ - password (local, NIS/LDAP, Active Directory), public/private key pair-based,\
        \ certificate based.\n4. RBAC role - determines what operations are permitted\
        \ for the user account.<p/>\n### Restrictions\nA number of internal/restricted\
        \ account names, such as admin, diag, autosupport, root cannot be used.<p/>\n\
        There must be at least one console cluster administrator account. Any attempt\
        \ to delete the last remaining administrator account fails.<p/>\nMulti-factor\
        \ authentication is only possible for SSH application and the only combination\
        \ possible is password (local or NIS/LDAP) and public key.<p/>\nAll authentication\
        \ sources are not supported by all applications. You must select a compatible\
        \ authentication method based on the application. The following types of authentications\
        \ methods are supported:<p/>\n| Application       | Supported Authentication\
        \ Methods |\n| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |\n| console\
        \           | password |\n| service-processor | password |\n| HTTP       \
        \       | password, domain, nsswitch, cert |\n| ONTAPI            | password,\
        \ domain, nsswitch, cert |\n| SSH               | password, publickey (key\
        \ pair), domain, nsswitch |\n<br/>\nNote: In the above table, \"cert\" means\
        \ security certificate, \"domain\" means that the user directory server is\
        \ an external Active Directory, \"nsswitch\" means the directory server is\
        \ an external NIS or LDAP server. At login time, the user is authenticated\
        \ with these external directory servers which must be provisioned separately.<p/>\n\
        ## Examples\n### Creating a cluster-scoped user account\nSpecify the user\
        \ account name, role name, and the tuples (of application and authentication\
        \ methods) in the body of the POST request. The owner.uuid or owner.name are\
        \ not required to be specified for a cluster-scoped user account.<br/>\nNote:\
        \ Each entry in the applications array must be for a different application.\n\
        ```\n# The API:\nPOST \"/api/security/accounts\"\n# The call to create a cluster\
        \ user account with applications ssh, http and password authentication scheme:\n\
        curl -k -u <cluster_admin>:<password> -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/security/accounts\"\
        \ -d '{\"name\":\"cluster_user1\",\"applications\":[{\"application\":\"ssh\"\
        ,\"authentication_methods\":[\"password\"],\"second_authentication_method\"\
        :\"none\"},{\"application\":\"http\",\"authentication_methods\":[\"password\"\
        ]}],\"role\":\"admin\",\"password\":\"p@ssw@rd123\"}'\nNote: The password\
        \ is an optional parameter for creation and can be set later using a PATCH\
        \ request. See the examples for modification of user account or password.\n\
        ```\n### Creating an SVM-scoped user account\nFor an SVM-scoped account, specify\
        \ either the SVM name as the owner.name or SVM uuid as the owner.uuid along\
        \ with other parameters for the user account. These indicate the SVM for which\
        \ the user account is being created and can be obtained from the response\
        \ body of GET performed on the <i>/api/svm/svms</i> API.\n```\n# The API:\n\
        POST \"/api/security/accounts\"\n# The call:\ncurl -k -u <cluster_admin>:<password>\
        \ -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/security/accounts\" -d '{\"owner\":{\"uuid\"\
        :\"aaef7c38-4bd3-11e9-b238-0050568e2e25\"},\"name\":\"svm_user1\",\"applications\"\
        :[{\"application\":\"ssh\",\"authentication_methods\":[\"password\"],\"second_authentication_method\"\
        :\"none\"}],\"role\":\"vsadmin\",\"password\":\"p@ssw@rd123\"}'\n```\n###\
        \ Retrieving the configured user accounts\nUse the following API to retrieve\
        \ all of the user accounts or a filtered list of user accounts (by name, for\
        \ a specific SVM, and so on).\n```\n# The API:\nGET \"/api/security/accounts\"\

        \ computers. NIS domain name and NIS server information is required to configure\
        \ NIS. This API retrieves and manages NIS server configurations.\n## Examples\n\
        ### Retrieving cluster NIS information\nThe cluster NIS GET operation retrieves\
        \ the NIS configuration of the cluster.<br>\nThe following example shows how\
        \ a GET operation is used to retrieve the cluster NIS configuration:\n```\n\
        # The API:\n/security/authentication/cluster/nis\n# The call:\ncurl -X GET\
        \ \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/security/authentication/cluster/nis\" -H \"accept:\
        \ application/hal+json\"\n# The response:\n{\n  \"domain\": \"domainA.example.com\"\

        bound_servers\": [\n    \"10.10.10.10\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n### Creating the cluster\
        \ NIS configuration\nThe cluster NIS POST operation creates a NIS configuration\
        \ for the cluster.<br>\nThe following example shows how a POST operation is\
        \ used to create a cluster NIS configuration:\n```\n# The API:\n/security/authentication/cluster/nis\n\
        # The call:\ncurl -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/security/authentication/cluster/nis\"\
        \ -H \"accept: application/json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d\
        \ \"{ \\\"domain\\\": \\\"domainA.example.com\\\", \\\"servers\\\": [ \\\"\
        10.10.10.10\\\",\\\"example.com\\\" ]}\"\n```\n### Updating the cluster NIS\
        \ configuration\nThe cluster NIS PATCH operation updates the NIS configuration\
        \ of the cluster.<br>\nThe following example shows how to update the domain:\n\
        ```\n# The API:\n/security/authentication/cluster/nis\n# The call:\ncurl -X\
        \ PATCH \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/security/authentication/cluster/nis\" -H \"\
        accept: application/json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{ \\\
        \"domain\\\": \\\"domainC.example.com\\\", \\\"servers\\\": [ \\\"13.13.13.13\\\
        \" ]}\"\n```\nThe following example shows how to update the server:\n```\n\
        # The API:\n/security/authentication/cluster/nis\n# The call:\ncurl -X PATCH\
        \ \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/security/authentication/cluster/nis\" -H \"accept:\
        \ application/json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{ \\\"servers\\\
        \": [ \\\"14.14.14.14\\\" ]}\"\n```\n## Deleting the cluster NIS configuration\n\
        The cluster NIS DELETE operation deletes the NIS configuration of the cluster.<br>\n\
        The following example shows how a DELETE operation is used to delete the cluster\
        \ NIS configuration:\n```\n# The API:\n/security/authentication/cluster/nis\n\
        # The call:\ncurl -X DELETE \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/security/authentication/cluster/nis\"\
        \ -H \"accept: application/hal+json\"\n```\n---\n"

        \ administrator, you can change your own password only.\n## Examples\n###\
        \ Changing the password of another cluster or SVM user account by a cluster\
        \ administrator\nSpecify the user account name, and the new password in the\
        \ body of the POST request. The owner.uuid or owner.name are not required\
        \ to be specified for a cluster-scoped user account.<p/>\nFor an SVM-scoped\
        \ account, along with new password and user account name, specify either the\
        \ SVM name as the owner.name or SVM uuid as the owner.uuid in the body of\
        \ the POST request. These indicate the SVM for which the user account is created\
        \ and can be obtained from the response body of a GET request performed on\
        \ the <i>/api/svm/svms</i> API.\n```\n# The API:\nPOST \"/api/security/authentication/password\"\

        owner.name\":\"svm1\",\"name\":\"svm_user1\",\"password\":\"hello@1234\"}'\n\
        ```\n### Changing the password of an SVM-scoped user\nNote: The IP address\
        \ in the URI must be same as one of the interfaces owned by the SVM.\n```\n\

      description: "## Overview\nA key manager is a key management solution (software\
        \ or dedicated hardware) that enables other ONTAP client modules to securely\
        \ and persistently store keys for various uses. For example, WAFL uses the\
        \ key management framework to store and retrieve the volume encryption keys\
        \ that it uses to encrypt/decrypt data on NVE volumes. A key manager can be\
        \ configured at both cluster scope and SVM, with one key manager allowed per\
        \ SVM. The key management framework in ONTAP supports two mutually exclusive\
        \ modes for persisting keys, external and onboard.<p/>\nWhen an SVM is configured\
        \ with external key management, the keys are stored on up to four key servers\
        \ that are external to the system.<p/>\nOnce external key management is enabled\
        \ for an SVM, key servers can be added or removed using the <i>/api/security/key-managers/{uuid}/key-servers</i>\
        \ endpoint. See [`POST /security/key-managers/{uuid}/key-servers`] and [`DELETE\
        \ /security/key-managers/{uuid}/key-servers/{server}`] for more details.<p/>\n\
        Setting up external key management dictates that the required certificates\
        \ for securely communicating with the key server are installed prior to configuring\
        \ the key manager. To install the required client and server_ca certificates,\
        \ use the <i>/api/security/certificates/</i> endpoint. <p/>\nSee [`POST /security/certificates`],\
        \ [`GET /security/certificates/uuid`] and [`DELETE /security/certificates/{uuid}`]\
        \ for more details.<p/>\nWhen an SVM is configured with onboard key management,\
        \ the keys are stored in ONTAP in wrapped format using a key hierarchy created\
        \ using the salted hash of the passphrase entered when configuring onboard\
        \ key management. This model fits well for customers who use ONTAP to store\
        \ their own data. <p/>\n## Examples\n### Creating an external key manager\
        \ with 1 key server for a cluster\nThe example key manager is configured at\
        \ the cluster-scope with one key server. Note that the UUIDs of the certificates\
        \ are those that are already installed at the cluster-scope. Note the <i>return_records=true</i>\
        \ query parameter is used to obtain the newly created key manager configuration<br/>\n\

      description: "## Overview\nONTAP supports Role Based Access Control (RBAC) wherein\
        \ a user account must be associated with a role and the role defines the privileges\
        \ and rights for that user account. A privilege defines the access level of\
        \ the API as either \"none\", \"readonly\", or \"all\". This specifies whether\
        \ the user account can perform only a GET operation or POST, PATCH, and DELETE\
        \ operations as well. A role can comprise of multiple tuples and each tuple\
        \ consists of the REST API and its access level.\nFor example, \"role1\" might\
        \ be a role that has a tuple {\"access\":\"all\",\"path\":\"/api/storage/volume\"\
        }, which means that a user account with \"role1\" can perform all GET, POST,\
        \ PATCH, and DELETE operations on the <i>api/storage/volume</i> API or derived\
        \ APIs which have <i>api/storage/volume</i> as the prefix.<p/>\nIn cases where\
        \ a role has tuples with multiple APIs having the same prefix, the highest\
        \ match wins out.\nFor example, if \"role1\" has the following tuples: {\"\
        access\":\"readonly\",\"path\":\"/api/cluster\"} and {\"access\":\"all\",\"\
        path\":\"/api/cluster/schedules\"}, then only a GET operation is allowed on\
        \ APIs with <i>api/cluster</i> as the prefix; while POST, PATCH and DELETE\
        \ operations are possible on the <i>api/cluster/schedules</i> API.\n### Predefined\
        \ (built-in) roles\nRelated REST APIs are used to form predefined cluster-scoped\
        \ and SVM-scoped roles, such as: \"admin\", \"backup\", \"readonly\" for cluster\
        \ and \"vsadmin\", \"vsadmin-backup\", \"vsadmin-protocol\" for SVMs.\nThese\
        \ can be retrieved by calling a GET request on <i>/api/security/roles</i>\
        \ API and can be assigned to user accounts. See the examples for <i>api/security/accounts</i>.<br/>\n\
        These predefined roles cannot be modified or deleted.\n### Mapped roles\n\
        Before REST APIs, the RBAC roles (legacy roles) were defined to contain the\
        \ CLI commands and their access levels. Now, almost all REST APIs map to one\
        \ or more CLI commands. When a role is created using a POST request on <i>/api/security/roles</i>,\
        \ a mapped legacy role is created. This legacy role has the same access level\
        \ (as that of the REST API) for the mapped CLI commands. However, if a legacy\
        \ role with the same name already exists, the POST operation fails and you\
        \ need to choose a unique name for the role. The legacy roles cannot be managed\
        \ using the REST endpoint <i>/api/security/roles</i> or its derivatives. Legacy\
        \ roles are managed using the CLI commands \"security login role <create |\
        \ modify | delete> -role <rolename>\".<p/>\nNote that the mapped legacy role\
        \ (for the REST API role created) cannot be manipulated using the CLI.<br/>\n\
        The reverse case is not true - the creation of a legacy role will not create\
        \ a mapped role with equivalent REST APIs.<p/>\n### API restrictions\nNumerous\
        \ APIs are scoped for the cluster level only. This results in an access error\
        \ if assigned to an SVM-scoped role. For example, <i>api/cluster/nodes</i>\
        \ does not work when added as a tuple entry for an SVM-scoped role.<p/>\n\
        A number of APIs allowed for an SVM-scoped role might have restrictions on\
        \ the access level. For example, <i>/api/network/ethernet/ports</i> cannot\
        \ have an access level of \"all\" for an SVM-scoped role; this results in\
        \ an access error when a POST or PATCH request is made.<p/>\nRoles created\
        \ with a REST API path prefix which is common to many APIs might have restrictions\
        \ based on the scope of the role; cluster or SVM.\nFor example, {\"access\"\
        :\"all\",\"path\":\"/api/security\"} might be a tuple entry for an SVM role.\
        \ Any GET, POST, PATCH, or DELETE operation fails on API <i>/api/security/accounts</i>\
        \ while the same on <i>/api/security/login/messages</i> succeeds. However,\
        \ a role with exactly the same tuple when created at the cluster-scope level\
        \ allows the operations.<p/>\nNumerous APIs have restrictions on the objects\
        \ that can be operated on based on the context of the SVM or cluster. For\
        \ example, a POST request on <i>/api/security/authentication/password</i>\
        \ API changes the password for a user account. If executed in the context\
        \ of an SVM (POST request on an SVM interface), only the password of the user\
        \ executing the POST can be modified, and attempts to modify the password\
        \ of any other user results in an access error. However, if a POST request\
        \ is performed by a cluster administrator account, the password for any user\
        \ account (cluster or SVM) can be modified.<p/>\n## Examples\n### Creating\
        \ a cluster-scoped custom role\nSpecify the role name and the tuples (of REST\
        \ APIs and their access level) in the body of the POST request. The owner.uuid\
        \ or owner.name are not required to be specified for a cluster-scoped role.<br/>\n\
        ```\n# The API:\nPOST \"/api/security/roles\"\n# The call:\ncurl -k -u <cluster-admin>:<password>\
        \ -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/security/roles\" -d '{\"name\":\"cluster_role\"\
        , \"privileges\" : [{\"access\":\"readonly\",\"path\":\"/api/cluster/jobs\"\
        },{\"access\":\"all\",\"path\":\"/api/application/applications\"},{\"access\"\
        :\"readonly\",\"path\":\"/api/application/templates\"}]}'\n```\n### Creating\
        \ an SVM-scoped custom role\nFor an SVM scoped role, specify either owner.name\
        \ or owner.uuid in the request body along with other parameters for the role.\
        \ These correspond to the name or UUID of the SVM for which the role is being\
        \ created and can be obtained from the response body of GET performed on the\
        \ <i>/api/svm/svms</i> API.<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPOST \"/api/security/roles\"\
        \n# The call:\ncurl -k -u <cluster-admin>:<password> -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/security/roles\"\
        \ -d '{\"owner\": {\"uuid\" : \"9f93e553-4b02-11e9-a3f9-005056bb7acd\"},\"\
        name\":\"svm_role\", \"privileges\" : [{\"access\":\"readonly\",\"path\":\"\
        /api/cluster/jobs\"},{\"access\":\"all\",\"path\":\"/api/application/applications\"\
        },{\"access\":\"readonly\",\"path\":\"/api/application/templates\"}]}'\n```\n\
        ### Retrieving the configured roles\nAll of the roles or a filtered list of\
        \ roles (for example by name, predefined, and so on) can be retrieved.<br/>\n\
        ```\n# The API:\nGET \"/api/security/roles\"\n# The call to retrieve all the\
        \ roles configured in the cluster:\ncurl -k -u <cluster_admin>:<password>\

      description: "## Overview\nA role can comprise of multiple tuples and each tuple\
        \ consists of the REST API path and its access level. These APIs can be used\
        \ to retrieve and modify the access level or delete one of the constituent\
        \ REST API paths within a role.<p/>\nThe role can be SVM-scoped or cluster-scoped.<p/>\n\
        Specify the owner UUID and the role name in the URI path. The owner UUID corresponds\
        \ to the UUID of the SVM for which the role has been created and can be obtained\
        \ from the response body of a GET call performed on one of the following APIs:\n\
        <i>/api/security/roles</i> for all roles\n<i>/api/security/roles/?scope=svm</i>\
        \ for SVM-scoped roles\n<i>/api/security/roles/?owner.name=<svm-name></i>\
        \ for roles in a specific SVM\nThis API response contains the complete URI\
        \ for each tuple of the role and can be used for GET, PATCH, or DELETE operations.<p/>\n\
        Note: The access level for paths in pre-defined roles cannot be updated.\n\

        \ between the source and destination which can be used to transfer APIs to\
        \ perform SnapMirror \"restore\" operations.<br/>\nTo create FlexVol or FlexGroup\
        \ SnapMirror relationships, the source volume must be in the \"online\" state\
        \ and be a read-write type; the destination volume must be in the \"online\"\
        \ state and be a data protection type.\nTo create SnapMirror relationships\
        \ between SVMs, the source SVM must be of subtype \"default\" and the destination\
        \ SVM of subtype \"dp_destination\". Additionally, SVMs must be peered before\
        \ a relationship can be established between them.\nThe SnapMirror functionality\

        \ APIs are used to create and manage the SnapMirror relationships.\n- SnapMirror\

      description: "## Retrieving storage aggregate information\nThe Storage Aggregate\
        \ GET API retrieves all data aggregates in the cluster. System owned root\
        \ aggregates are not included in the output.\nThis API also supports specific\
        \ queries, in addition to queries on aggregate body properties, which affect\
        \ the output of the API. The parameters\nfor these queries are \"recommend\"\
        \ and \"show_spares\". Using the \"recommend\" query returns the list of aggregates\
        \ that are\nrecommended for creation in the cluster. The \"show_spares\" query\
        \ returns a response outside of the records body, which includes the groups\n\
        of usable spares in the cluster.</br>\nThe collection GET returns the aggregate\
        \ identifiers, UUID and name, and the node on which the aggregate resides.\
        \ The instance GET, by default, returns all of the properties defined in the\
        \ aggregates object, except advanced properties.\nThe properties \"space.footprint\"\
        \ and \"space.block_storage.inactive_user_data\" are considered advanced properties\
        \ and only returned when requested\nusing the \"fields\" query parameter.\n\
        ## Creating storage aggregates\nWhen the POST command is issued with no properties,\
        \ the system evaluates the cluster attached storage, determines the optimal\
        \ aggregate layout and configures the aggregates. This layout is completely\
        \ controlled by the system.\nTo view the recommended optimal layout rather\
        \ than creating it, use the GET endpoint, setting the \"recommend\" query\
        \ to 'true'.\nAlternatively, POST can be used with specific properties to\
        \ create an aggregate as requested. At a minimum, the\naggregate name, disk\
        \ count, and the node where it should reside are required if any properties\
        \ are provided.</br>\nWhen using POST with input properties, three properties\
        \ are required. These are:\n- name\n- node.name or node.uuid\n- block_storage.primary.disk_count\n\
        ### Remaining properties are optional\nThe following properties can be specified\
        \ in POST:\n* name - Name of the aggregate.\n* node.name and node.uuid - Node\
        \ on which the aggregate will be created.\n* block_storage.primary.disk_count\
        \ - Number of disks to be used to create the aggregate.\n* block_storage.mirror.enabled\
        \ - Specifies whether or not the aggregate should be created using SyncMirror.\n\
        * block_storage.primary.checksum_style - Checksum style of the disks to be\
        \ use for the aggregate.\n* block_storage.primary.disk_class - Class of disks\
        \ to be use to for the aggregate.\n* block_storage.primary.raid_size - Desired\
        \ RAID size of the aggregate.\n* block_storage.primary.raid_type - Desired\
        \ RAID type of the aggregate.\n* snaplock_type - SnapLock type to use on the\
        \ aggregate.\n## Updating storage aggregates\nThe PATCH operation is used\
        \ to modify properties of the aggregate. There are several properties that\
        \ can be modified on an aggregate. Only one property can be modified for each\
        \ PATCH request. </br>\nThe list of patchable properties with a brief description\
        \ for each is as follows:\n* name - This property can be changed to rename\
        \ the aggregate.\n* node.name and node.uuid - Either property can be updated\
        \ in order to relocate the aggregate to a different node in the cluster.\n\
        * block_storage.mirror.enabled - This property can be changed from 'false'\
        \ to 'true' in order to mirror the aggregate, if the system is capable of\
        \ doing so.\n* block_storage.primary.disk_count - This property can be updated\
        \ to increase the number of disks in an aggregate.\n* block_storage.primary.raid_size\
        \ - This property can be updated to set the desired RAID size.\n* block_storage.primary.raid_type\
        \ - This property can be updated to set the desired RAID type.\n* cloud_storage.tiering_fullness_threshold\
        \ - This property can be updated to set the desired tiering fullness threshold\
        \ if using FabricPool.\n## Deleting storage aggregates\nIf volumes exist on\
        \ an aggregate, they must be deleted or moved before the aggregate can be\
        \ deleted.\nSee the /storage/volumes API for details on moving or deleting\
        \ volumes.\n---\n## Examples\n### Retrieving a list of aggregates from the\
        \ cluster\nThe following example shows the response with a list of data aggregates\
        \ in the cluster:\n```\n# The API:\n/api/storage/aggregates\n# The call:\n\

        \ aggregate.<br>\nStep 1: Check the current disk count on the aggregate.\n\
        ```\n# The API:\n/api/storage/aggregates\n# The call:\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/storage/aggregates/19425837-f2fa-4a9f-8f01-712f626c983c?fields=block_storage.primary.disk_count\"\

        \    \"disk_count\": 6\n    }\n  },\n}\n```\nStep 2: Update the aggregate\
        \ with the new disk count in 'block_storage.primary.disk_count'. The response\
        \ to PATCH is a job unless the request is invalid.\n```\n# The API:\n/api/storage/aggregates\n\
        # The call:\ncurl -X PATCH \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/storage/aggregates/19425837-f2fa-4a9f-8f01-712f626c983c\"\
        \ -H \"accept: application/hal+json\" -d \"{\\\"block_storage\\\": {\\\"primary\\\
        \": {\\\"disk_count\\\": 8}}}\"\n# The response:\n{\n  \"job\": {\n    \"\

        \n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nStep 3: Wait for the job to finish, then call\
        \ GET to see the reflected change.\n```\n# The API:\n/api/storage/aggregates\n\
        # The call:\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/storage/aggregates/19425837-f2fa-4a9f-8f01-712f626c983c?fields=block_storage.primary.disk_count\"\

      description: "## Overview\nFlexCache is a persistent cache of an origin volume.\
        \ An origin volume can only be a FlexVol while a FlexCache is always a FlexGroup.</br>\n\
        The following relationship configurations are supported:</br>\n&ndash; Intra-Vserver\
        \ where FlexCache and the corresponding origin volume reside in the same Vserver.\n\
        &ndash; Cross-Vserver but intra-cluster where FlexCache and the origin volume\
        \ reside in the same cluster but belong to different Vservers.\n&ndash; Cross-cluster\
        \ where FlexCache and the origin volume reside in different clusters.</br>\n\
        FlexCache supports fan-out and more than one FlexCache can be created from\
        \ one origin volume.\nThis API retrieves and manages FlexCache configurations\
        \ in the cache cluster.\n## FlexCache APIs\nThe following APIs can be used\
        \ to perform operations related with FlexCache:\n&ndash; GET       /api/storage/flexcache/flexcaches\n\
        &ndash; GET       /api/storage/flexcache/flexcaches/{uuid}\n&ndash; POST \
        \     /api/storage/flexcache/flexcaches\n&ndash; DELETE    /api/storage/flexcache/flexcaches/{uuid}\n\
        ## Examples\n### Creating a FlexCache\nThe POST request is used to create\
        \ a FlexCache.\n```\n# The API:\n/api/storage/flexcache/flexcaches\n# The\
        \ call:\ncurl -X POST \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/storage/flexcache/flexcaches\"\
        \ -H  \"accept: application/json\" -H  \"Content-Type: application/json\"\

        vs_3\\\"  }, \\\"volume\\\": { \\\"name\\\": \\\"vol_o1\\\" } } ], \\\"svm\\\
        \": { \\\"name\\\": \\\"vs_1\\\" } }\"\n# The response:\n{\n  \"job\": {\n\

      description: "## Overview\nFlexCache is a persistent cache of an origin volume.\
        \ An origin volume can only be a FlexVol while a FlexCache is always a FlexGroup.</br>\n\
        The following relationship configurations are supported:\n&ndash; Intra-Vserver\
        \ where FlexCache and the corresponding origin volume reside in the same Vserver.\n\
        &ndash; Cross-Vserver but intra-cluster where FlexCache and the origin volume\
        \ reside in the same cluster but belong to different Vservers.\n&ndash; Cross-cluster\
        \ where FlexCache and the origin volume reside in different clusters.</br>\n\
        FlexCache supports fan-out and more than one FlexCache can be created from\
        \ one origin volume.\nThis API retrieves the origin of FlexCache onfigurations\
        \ in the origin cluster.\n## FlexCache APIs\nThe following APIs can be used\
        \ to perform operations related to the origin of a FlexCache:\n&ndash; GET\
        \       /api/storage/flexcache/origins\n&ndash; GET       /api/storage/flexcache/origins/{uuid}\n\
        ## Examples\n### Retrieving origins of FlexCache attributes\nThe GET request\
        \ is used to retrieve the origins of FlexCache attributes.\n```\n# The API:\n\
        /api/storage/flexcache/origins\n# The call:\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/storage/flexcache/origins?\"\

      description: "## Overview\nA LUN is the logical representation of storage in\
        \ a storage area network (SAN).<br/>\nThe LUN REST API allows you to create,\
        \ update, delete, and discover LUNs.<br/>\nIn ONTAP, a LUN is located within\
        \ a volume. Optionally, it can be located within a qtree in a volume.<br/>\n\
        A LUN can be created to a specified size using thin or thick provisioning.\
        \ A LUN can then be renamed, resized, cloned, and moved to a different volume.\
        \ LUNs support the assignment of a quality of service (QoS) policy for performance\
        \ management or a QoS policy can be assigned to the volume containing the\
        \ LUN. See the LUN object model to learn more about each of the properties\
        \ supported by the LUN REST API.<br/>\nA LUN must be mapped to an initiator\
        \ group to grant access to the initiator group's initiators (client hosts).\
        \ Initiators can then access the LUN and perform I/O over a Fibre Channel\
        \ (FC) fabric using the FC Protocol or a TCP/IP network using iSCSI.\n## Examples\n\
        ### Creating a LUN\nThis example creates a 300 gigabyte, thin-provisioned\
        \ LUN in SVM _svm1_, volume _vol1_, configured for use by _linux_ initiators.\
        \ The `return_records` query parameter is used to retrieve properties of the\
        \ newly created LUN in the POST response.\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPOST /api/storage/luns\n\

        \ \"copy\" of the LUN that shares unchanged data blocks with the original.\
        \ As blocks of the source and clone are modified, unique blocks are written\
        \ for each. LUN clones can be created quickly and consume very little space\
        \ initially. They can be created for the purpose of back-up, or to replicate\
        \ data for multiple consumers.<br/>\nSpace reservations can be set for the\
        \ LUN clone independent of the source LUN by setting the `space.guarantee.requested`\
        \ property in a POST or PATCH request.<br/>\nA LUN clone can also be set to\
        \ auto-delete by setting the `auto_delete` property. If the LUN's volume is\
        \ configured for automatic deletion, LUNs that have auto-delete enabled are\
        \ deleted when a volume is nearly full to reclaim a target amount of free\
        \ space in the volume.\n## Examples\n### Creating a new LUN clone\nYou create\
        \ a new LUN clone as you create any LUN -- a POST to [`/storage/luns`](#/SAN/lun_create).\
        \ Set `clone.source.uuid` or `clone.source.name` to identify the source LUN\
        \ from which the clone is created. The LUN clone and its source must reside\
        \ in the same volume.\n<br/>\nThe source LUN can reside in a Snapshot copy,\
        \ in which case the `clone.source.name` field must be used to identify it.\
        \ Add `/.snapshot/<snapshot_name>` to the path after the volume name to identify\
        \ the Snapshot copy. For example `/vol/vol1/.snapshot/snap1/lun1`.\n<br/>\n\
        By default, new LUN clones do not inherit the QoS policy of the source LUN;\
        \ a QoS policy should be set for the clone by setting the `qos_policy` property.\n\
        <br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPOST /api/storage/luns\n# The call:\ncurl -X POST\
        \ 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/storage/luns' -H 'accept: application/hal+json' -d\
        \ '{ \"svm\": { \"name\": \"svm1\" }, \"name\": \"/vol/vol1/lun2clone1\",\
        \ \"clone\": { \"source\": { \"name\": \"/vol/vol1/lun2\" } }, \"qos_policy\"\
        : { \"name\": \"qos1\" } }'\n```\n### Over-writing an existing LUN's data\
        \ as a clone of another\nYou can over-write an existing LUN as a clone of\
        \ another. You do this as a PATCH on the LUN to overwrite -- a PATCH to [`/storage/luns/{uuid}`](#/SAN/lun_modify).\
        \ Set the `clone.source.uuid` or `clone.source.name` property to identify\
        \ the source LUN from which the clone data is taken. The LUN clone and its\
        \ source must reside in the same volume.<br/>\nWhen used in a PATCH, the patched\
        \ LUN's data is over-written as a clone of the source. The following properties\
        \ are preserved from the patched LUN unless otherwise specified as part of\
        \ the PATCH: `class`, `auto_delete`, `lun_maps`, `serial_number`, `status.state`,\
        \ and `uuid`.<br/>\nPersistent reservations for the patch LUN are also preserved.\n\
        <br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPATCH /api/storage/luns/{uuid}\n# The call:\ncurl\
        \ -X PATCH 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/storage/luns/5a24ae5b-28af-47fb-b129-5adf6cfba0a6'\
        \ -H 'accept: application/hal+json' -d '{ \"clone\": { \"source\": { \"name\"\
        : \"/vol/vol1/lun2\" } } }'\n```\n---\n## Moving LUNs between volumes\nYou\
        \ move a LUN between volumes by using a PATCH request to [`/storage/luns/{uuid}`](#/SAN/lun_modify).\
        \ Set the volume portion of the fully qualified LUN path `name` property,\
        \ `path.volume.uuid`, or `path.volume.name` property to a different volume\
        \ than the LUN's current volume. Moving a LUN between volumes is an asynchronous\
        \ activity. A successful request returns a response of 200 synchronously,\
        \ which indicates that the movement has been successfully queued. The LUN\
        \ object can then be further polled with a GET request to [`/storage/luns/{uuid}`](#lun_get)\
        \ to monitor the status of the movement.<br/>\nThe `movement` sub-object of\
        \ the LUN object is populated while a LUN movement is in progress and for\
        \ two minutes following completion of a movement.\n## Examples\n### Starting\
        \ a LUN movement\n```\n# The API:\nPATCH /api/storage/luns/{uuid}\n# The call:\n\

      description: "## Overview\nAn NVMe namespace is a collection of addressable\
        \ logical blocks presented to hosts connected to the storage virtual machine\
        \ using the NVMe over Fabrics protocol.<br/>\nThe NVMe namespace REST API\
        \ allows you to create, update, delete and discover NVMe namespaces.<br/>\n\
        In ONTAP, an NVMe namespace is located within a volume. Optionally, it can\
        \ be located within a qtree in a volume.<br/>\nAn NVMe namespace is created\
        \ to a specified size using thin or thick provisioning as determined by the\
        \ volume on which it is created. NVMe namespaces support being cloned. An\
        \ NVMe namespace cannot be renamed, resized, or moved to a different volume.\
        \ NVMe namespaces do not support the assignment of a QoS policy for performance\
        \ management, but a QoS policy can be assigned to the volume containing the\
        \ namespace. See the NVMe namespace object model to learn more about each\
        \ of the properties supported by the NVMe namespace REST API.<br/>\nAn NVMe\
        \ namespace must be mapped to an NVMe subsystem to grant access to the subsystem's\
        \ hosts. Hosts can then access the NVMe namespace and perform I/O using the\
        \ NVMe over Fabrics protocol.\n## Examples\n### Creating an NVMe namespace\n\
        This example creates a 300 gigabyte NVMe namespace, with 4096-byte blocks,\
        \ in SVM _svm1_, volume _vol1_, configured for use by _linux_ hosts. The `return_records`\
        \ query parameter is used to retrieve properties of the newly created NVMe\
        \ namespace in the POST response.\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPOST /api/storage/namespaces\n\

        \ namespace is an independent \"copy\" of the namespace that shares unchanged\
        \ data blocks with the original. As blocks of the source and clone are modified,\
        \ unique blocks are written for each. NVMe namespace clones can be created\
        \ quickly and consume very little space initially. They can be created for\
        \ the purpose of back-up, or to replicate data for multiple consumers.<br/>\n\
        An NVMe namespace clone can also be set to auto-delete by setting the `auto_delete`\
        \ property. If the namespace's volume is configured for automatic deletion,\
        \ NVMe namespaces that have auto-delete enabled are deleted when a volume\
        \ is nearly full to reclaim a target amount of free space in the volume.\n\
        ### Creating a new NVMe namespace clone\nYou create an NVMe namespace clone\
        \ as you create any NVMe namespace -- a POST to [`/storage/namespaces`](#/NVMe/nvme_namespace_create).\
        \ Set `clone.source.uuid` or `clone.source.name` to identify the source NVMe\
        \ namespace from which the clone is created. The NVMe namespace clone and\
        \ its source must reside in the same volume.\n<br/>\nThe source NVMe namespace\
        \ can reside in a Snapshot copy, in which case, the `clone.source.name` field\
        \ must be used to identify it. Add `/.snapshot/<snapshot_name>` to the path\
        \ after the volume name to identify the Snapshot copy. For example `/vol/vol1/.snapshot/snap1/namespace1`.\n\
        <br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPOST /api/storage/namespaces\n# The call:\ncurl -X\
        \ POST 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/storage/namespaces' -H 'accept: application/hal+json'\
        \ -d '{ \"svm\": { \"name\": \"svm1\" }, \"name\": \"/vol/vol1/namespace2clone1\"\
        , \"clone\": { \"source\": { \"name\": \"/vol/vol1/namespace2\" } } }'\n```\n\
        ---\n### Over-writing an existing NVMe namespace's data as a clone of another\n\
        You can over-write an existing NVMe namespace as a clone of another. You do\
        \ this as a PATCH on the NVMe namespace to overwrite -- a PATCH to [`/storage/namespaces/{uuid}`](#/NVMe/nvme_namespace_modify).\
        \ Set the `clone.source.uuid` or `clone.source.name` property to identify\
        \ the source NVMe namespace from which the clone data is taken. The NVMe namespace\
        \ clone and its source must reside in the same volume.<br/>\nWhen used in\
        \ a PATCH, the patched NVMe namespace's data is over-written as a clone of\
        \ the source and the following properties are preserved from the patched namespace\
        \ unless otherwise specified as part of the PATCH: `auto_delete`, `subsystem_map`,\
        \ `status.state`, and `uuid`.\n<br/>\n```\n# The API:\nPATCH /api/storage/namespaces/{uuid}\n\
        # The call:\ncurl -X PATCH 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/storage/namespaces/dccdc3e6-cf4e-498f-bec6-f7897f945669'\
        \ -H 'accept: application/hal+json' -d '{ \"clone\": { \"source\": { \"name\"\
        : \"/vol/vol1/namespace2\" } } }'\n```\n---\n## Deleting an NVMe namespace\n\
        ```\n# The API:\nDELETE /api/storage/namespaces/{uuid}\n# The call:\ncurl\
        \ -X DELETE 'https://<mgmt-ip>/api/storage/namespaces/5c254d22-96a6-42ac-aad8-0cd9ebd126b6'\
        \ -H 'accept: application/hal+json'\n```\n---\n"

      description: "## Quality of Service Configuration\nA QoS policy defines measurable\
        \ service level objectives (SLOs) that apply to the storage objects with which\
        \ the policy is associated. There are two types of policies that can be configured,\
        \ fixed which define a fixed SLO, or adaptive which defines a variable SLO\
        \ for a storage object. Adaptive policies vary the SLO depending on the space\
        \ usage of the storage object. A policy can be either a fixed policy or an\
        \ adaptive one not both.\n<br />\nService level objectives include minimum\
        \ and maximum limits on throughput in terms of IOPS. Only maximum limits can\
        \ be set in terms of both IOPS and/or throughput (MB/s). A QoS policy can\
        \ be used to enforce SLOs for multiple storage objects by specifying \"capacity_shared\"\
        \ to true. For e.g. if a QoS policy with \"capacity_shared\" is set to true\
        \ and it has maximum_throughput_iops set to 1000, and this policy is assigned\
        \ to four volumes, then the combined throughput of all four volumes would\
        \ be limited to 1000 IOPS. If \"capacity_shared\" is set to false then, each\
        \ storage object will have it's SLOs enforced individually. For e.g. In the\
        \ previous case if the same policy were applied to four volumes but with \"\
        capacity_shared\" set to false, then each of the volumes would be limited\
        \ to 1000 IOPS individually. Once \"capacity_shared\" is set it cannot be\
        \ modified.\n<br />\nAdaptive parameters can specify the variable SLOs in\
        \ terms of IOPS/TB, the actual IOPS enforced on the storage object can be\
        \ calculated using the allocated space on the storage object. The policies\
        \ are enforced individually amongst storage objects.\n## Examples\n### 1)\
        \ Create a fixed QoS policy\nThe following example shows how to create a fixed\
        \ QoS policy to limit throughput for a storage object between 5000 IOPS and\
        \ 10000 IOPS which has capacity_shared set to false. This QoS policy can be\
        \ used as a template to apply on multiple storage objects to provide individual\
        \ SLOs to each object.\n<br />\n---\n```\ncurl -X POST \"https://172.21.69.245/api/storage/qos/policies?return_timeout=0\"\
        \ -H \"accept: application/json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d\
        \ \"{ \\\"fixed\\\": { \\\"capacity_shared\\\": false, \\\"max_throughput_iops\\\
        \": 10000, \\\"min_throughput_iops\\\": 5000 }, \\\"name\\\": \\\"qos_policy_5000_to_10000_iops\\\
        \", \\\"svm\\\": { \\\"name\\\": \\\"vs0\\\" }}\"\n```\n---\n### 2) Create\
        \ an adaptive QoS policy\nThe following example shows how to create an adaptive\
        \ QoS policy which would provide 5000 IOPS per GB of allocated space for a\
        \ storage object with a peak of 6000 IOPS. Minimum IOPS regardless of allocated\
        \ space would be 1000 IOPS.\n<br />\n---\n```\ncurl -X POST \"https://172.21.69.245/api/storage/qos/policies?return_timeout=0\"\

        \": 5000, \\\"peak_iops\\\": 6000 }, \\\"name\\\": \\\"adaptive_pg_5k_to_6k\\\
        \", \\\"svm\\\": { \\\"name\\\": \\\"vs0\\\" }}\"\n```\n----\n### 3) Update\
        \ an existing QoS policy\nThe following example shows how to update SLOs of\
        \ an exisiting QoS policy and also rename it.\n<br />\n---\n```\ncurl -X PATCH\
        \ \"https://172.21.69.245/api/storage/qos/policies/d38bafc0-5a51-11e9-bd5b-005056ac6f1f?return_timeout=0\"\

        \": 10000 }, \\\"name\\\": \\\"qos_policy_10k_to_15k_iops\\\"}\"\n```\n---\n\
        ### 4) Delete an existing QoS policy\nWhen a QoS policy is deleted any associations\
        \ of the policy with a storage objects are also removed.\n<br />\n---\n```\n\
        curl -X DELETE \"https://172.21.69.245/api/storage/qos/policies/d38bafc0-5a51-11e9-bd5b-005056ac6f1f?return_timeout=0\"\

      description: "## Overview\nQuotas provide a way to restrict or track the files\
        \ and space usage by a user, group, or qtree. Quotas are enabled for a specific\
        \ FlexVol or a FlexGroup volume.</br>\nQuotas can have soft or hard limits.\
        \ Soft limits cause ONTAP to send a notification when specified limits are\
        \ exceeded. Hard limits prevent a write operation from succeeding when specified\
        \ limits are exceeded.</br>\n## Quota policy rule APIs\nQuotas are defined\
        \ as quota policy rules specific to FlexVol or FlexGroup volumes. Each quota\
        \ rule has a type. The type can be either \"user\", \"group\", or \"tree\"\
        .</br>\nThe following APIs can be used to perform create, retrieve, modify,\
        \ and delete operations related to quota policy rules for a FlexVol or a FlexGroup\
        \ volume.\n&ndash; POST      /api/storage/quota/rules\n&ndash; GET       /api/storage/quota/rules\n\

        \ /api/storage/quota/rules/{rule-uuid}\n&ndash; DELETE    /api/storage/quota/rules/{rule-uuid}\n\
        ## Enabling and disabling quotas\nAfter the quota rules are created, the quota\
        \ rules need to be enabled on each FlexVol or FlexGroup volume for soft or\
        \ hard limits to take effect in the filesystem. Enabling quotas can be done\
        \ on a volume-by-volume basis.</br>\nThe following APIs can be used to enable\
        \ and disable and obtain the quota state for a FlexVol or a FlexGroup volume.\n\
        &ndash; PATCH  /api/storage/volumes/{volume-uuid} -d '{\"quota.enabled\":\"\
        true\"}'\n&ndash; PATCH  /api/storage/volumes/{volume-uuid} -d '{\"quota.enabled\"\
        :\"false\"}'\n&ndash; GET    /api/storage/volumes/{volume-uuid}/?fields=quota.state\n\
        ## Quota report APIs\nQuota report records provide usage information for a\
        \ user, group, or qtree against the quota limits configured on a FlexVol or\
        \ a FlexGroup volume.\nThe following APIs can be used to retrieve quota reports\
        \ associated with a FlexVol or a FlexGroup volume.\n&ndash; GET    /api/storage/quota/reports\n\
        &ndash; GET    /api/storage/quota/reports/{volume-uuid}/{index}\n## Quota\
        \ resize\nQuota resize allows you to modify the quota limits directly in the\
        \ filesystem.</br>\nIt is important to note that quota must be enabled on\
        \ a FlexVol or a FlexGroup volume for `quota resize` to take effect.\nYou\
        \ can perform a `quota resize` using the quota policy rule PATCH API. If the\
        \ quota is disabled on the volume, the quota policy rule PATCH API modifies\
        \ the rule, but this does not affect the limits in the filesystem.\nThe following\
        \ API can be used to perform `quota resize` provided quota is enabled on the\
        \ volume.\n&ndash; PATCH  /api/storage/quota/rules/{rule-uuid}\nThe changed\
        \ limits in the filesystem can be confirmed using the quota report REST API.\n\

      description: "## Overview\nIn ONTAP, scheduled Snapshot copy creation works\
        \ based on Snapshot copy policies.\nONTAP provides three cluster wide Snapshot\
        \ copy policies, which are \"default\", \"default-1weekly\" and \"none\" policies.\n\
        A Snapshot copy policy can have more than one schedule associated with it.\n\
        A Snapshot copy policy can be linked to a storage object and based on the\
        \ schedule in the policy, Snapshot copies will be created on the object at\
        \ that interval.\nEach schedule in a Snapshot copy policy has a Snapshot copy\
        \ name prefix attached to it. Every Snapshot copy created using this policy\
        \ will have this prefix in its name.\nThere is also a retention count associated\
        \ with every schedule. This count indicates the maximum number of Snapshot\
        \ copies that can exist for a given schedule. So once the Snapshot copy count\
        \ reaches the retention count, on the next create the oldest Snapshot copy\
        \ is deleted.<br/>\n## Snapshot copy policy APIs\nThe following APIs are used\
        \ to perform operations related to Snapshot copy policy information:\n&ndash;\
        \ POST      /api/storage/snapshot_policies\n&ndash; GET       /api/storage/snapshot_policies\n\
        &ndash; GET       /api/storage/snapshot_policies/{uuid}\n&ndash; PATCH   \
        \  /api/storage/snapshot_policies/{uuid}\n&ndash; DELETE    /api/storage/snapshot_policies/{uuid}\n\
        ## Examples\n### Creating a Snapshot copy policy\nThe POST operation is used\

      description: "## Overview\nFlexVol volumes are logical containers used by ONTAP\
        \ to serve data to clients.  They contain file systems in a NAS environment\
        \ and LUNs in a SAN environment.<br/>\nA FlexGroup volume is a scale-out NAS\
        \ container that provides high performance along with automatic load distribution\
        \ and scalability. A FlexGroup volume contains several constituents that automatically\
        \ and transparently share the traffic.</br>\nFlexClone volumes are writable,\
        \ point-in-time copies of a FlexVol volume. At this time, FlexClones of FlexGroups\
        \ are not supported.<br/>\nVolumes with SnapLock type Compliance or Enterprise,\
        \ are referred to as SnapLock volumes. Volumes with SnapLock type cannot be\
        \ of FlexGroup style. Once a SnapLock aggregate is created, by default, volumes\
        \ created inside the aggregate inherit the \"snaplock\" property from the\
        \ aggregate.<br/>\nONTAP storage APIs allow you to create, modify, and monitor\
        \ volumes and aggregates.<br/>\n## Storage efficiency\nStorage efficiency\
        \ is used to remove duplicate blocks in the data and to compress the data.\
        \ Efficiency has deduplication, compression, cross volume deduplication, and\
        \ compaction options. On all-flash systems, all efficiencies will be enabled\
        \ by default on volume creation. Options such as \"background/inline/both\"\
        \ will be treated as both, which means both background and inline will be\
        \ enabled for any efficiency option. The option \"none\" will disable both\
        \ background and inline efficiency.<br/>\nTo enable any efficiency option\
        \ on all-flash or FAS systems, background deduplication is always enabled.<br/>\n\
        ## Quotas\nQuotas provide a way to restrict or track the files and space usage\
        \ by a user, group, or qtree. Quotas are enabled for a specific FlexVol or\
        \ a FlexGroup volume.<br/>\nThe following APIs can be used to enable or disable\
        \ and obtain quota state for a FlexVol or a FlexGroup volume:\n&ndash; PATCH\
        \  /api/storage/volumes/{volume-uuid} -d '{\"quota.enabled\":\"true\"}'\n\
        &ndash; PATCH  /api/storage/volumes/{volume-uuid} -d '{\"quota.enabled\":\"\
        false\"}'\n&ndash; GET    /api/storage/volumes/{volume-uuid}/?fields=quota.state\n\
        ## QoS\nQoS policy and settings enforce Service Level Objectives (SLO) on\
        \ a volume. SLO can be set by specifying qos.max_throughput_iops and/or qos.max_throughput_mbps\
        \ or qos.min_throughput_iops. Specifying min_throughput_iops is only supported\
        \ on volumes hosted on an a node which is flash optimized. A pre-created QoS\
        \ policy can also be used by specifying qos.name or qos.uuid property. <br/>\n\
        ## Performance monitoring\nPerformance of a volume can be monitored by the\
        \ `metric.*` and `statistics.*` fields. These show the performance of the\

      description: "## Overview\nA Snapshot copy is the view of the filesystem as\
        \ it exits at the point in time when the Snapshot copy is created. <br/>\n\
        In ONTAP, different types of Snapshot copies are supported, such as scheduled\
        \ Snapshot copies, user requested Snapshot copies, SnapMirror Snapshot copies,\
        \ and so on. <br/>\nONTAP Snapshot copy APIs allow you to create, modify,\
        \ delete and retrieve Snapshot copies. <br/>\n## Snapshot copy APIs\nThe following\
        \ APIs are used to perform operations related to Snapshot copies.\n&ndash;\
        \ POST      /api/storage/volumes/{volume.uuid}/snapshots\n&ndash; GET    \
        \   /api/storage/volumes/{volume.uuid}/snapshots\n&ndash; GET       /api/storage/volumes/{volume.uuid}/snapshots/{uuid}\n\
        &ndash; PATCH     /api/storage/volumes/{volume.uuid}/snapshots/{uuid}\n&ndash;\
        \ DELETE    /api/storage/volumes/{volume.uuid}/snapshots/{uuid}\n## Examples\n\

        \ sends configuration details, status details, and error reporting details\
        \ to NetApp.<p/>\nThis endpoint supports both GET and PATCH calls. GET is\
        \ used to retrieve AutoSupport configuration details for the cluster and PATCH\
        \ is used to modify the AutoSupport configuration of the cluster. GET calls\
        \ can also be used to check AutoSupport connectivity.\n---\n## Examples\n\
        ### Configuring 'to' addresses\nThe following example configures AutoSupport\
        \ to send emails to 'to' addresses.\n```JSON\n# The API:\nPATCH /support/autosupport\n\
        # The call:\ncurl -X PATCH \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/support/autosupport\" -H\

        # The response:\n200 OK\n{}\n```\n---\n### Configuring 'SMTP' transport\n\
        The following example configures AutoSupport to use 'SMTP' transport. The\
        \ default transport is 'HTTPS'.\n```JSON\n# The API:\nPATCH /support/autosupport\n\
        # The call:\ncurl -X PATCH \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/support/autosupport\" -H\
        \ \"accept: application/hal+json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d\
        \ \"{ \\\"transport\\\": \\\"smtp\\\"}\"\n# The response:\n200 OK\n{}\n```\n\
        ---\n### Retrieving the AutoSupport configuration\nThe following example retrieves\

        \ invoke an AutoSupport on a single node in the cluster.\nNote that AutoSupport\
        \ is invoked on all nodes in the cluster if the `node` param is omitted. You\
        \ can specify the node-name with either `node` or `node.name` parameter. You\
        \ can also specify UUID of the node with the `node.uuid` parameter.<p/>\n\

      description: "## Overview\nManages the list of destinations. A destination is\
        \ defined by a type and a place to which an event's information is transmitted.\n\
        ## Destination Types\nAn EMS destination is defined by a single type, which\
        \ is one of the following:\n- email\n- syslog\n- rest_api\n- snmp\n### E-mail\n\
        The 'email' type allows you to define a mail box where information about an\
        \ observed event is sent via SMTP. The address should be populate in the destination\
        \ field and be a valid format.\nFor example: administrator@mycompany.com\n\
        ### Syslog\nThe 'syslog' type allows you to specify a remote syslog server\
        \ that can receive information about an observed event. The hostname or IP\
        \ address should be populated in the destination field.\nFor example: syslog.mycompany.com,\
        \ 192.168.1.1\n### Rest API\nThe 'rest_api' type allows you to define a URL\
        \ where information about an observed event is sent using the REST protocol.\
        \ The URL should be populated in the destination field.\nThe URL must contain\
        \ a valid transmission schema which can be one of the following:\n- http\n\
        - https\nUsing the 'https' schema, you can configure a client-side certificate\
        \ if mutual authentication is desired.\nFor example: http://rest.mycompany.com,\
        \ https://192.168.1.1\n### SNMP\nThe 'snmp' type describes addresses where\
        \ information about an observed event is sent using SNMP traps. The system\
        \ defines a default instance of this type and it is restricted to read-only.\n\
        This type has the following limitations:\n- Cannot create new destinations\
        \ of type 'snmp'\n- Cannot modify the default 'snmp' destination\n</br>SNMP\
        \ trap host details need to be configured through one of the following:\n\
        | Type | Command / API |\n| ---- | ------------------- |\n| CLI  | 'system\
        \ snmp traphost' |\n| ZAPI | 'snmp-traphost-add' / 'snmp-traphost-delete'\
        \ |\n## Examples\n### Retrieving the list of active destinations\n```JSON\n\
        # API\nGET /api/support/ems/destinations\n# Response\n200 OK\n# JSON Body\n\

      description: "## Overview\nManages the list of available filters. A filter is\
        \ a named collection of rules that enable the system to identify events that\
        \ require additional handling. A filter is linked with a destination to which\
        \ the system sends specific events.</br>\nWhen an event is processed by EMS,\
        \ each filter is evaluated for a match. More than one filter can handle a\
        \ single event.\n### Filter rule position\nA filter's rules are evaluated\
        \ sequentially, according to their position index. When a rule is added or\
        \ modified, the position can be set to customize the filter's logic. If no\
        \ position is specified, a new rule is appended to the end of the list.\n\
        ### Filter rule types\nA filter rule can be one of two types: 'include' or\
        \ 'exclude'.\nIf an event matches the criteria of the rule, the type dictates\
        \ whether it should be forwarded to the destination or ignored.\n### Filter\
        \ rule matching criteria\nA valid filter rule must contain at least one set\
        \ of criteria.\n#### Name pattern\nA name pattern is matched against an event's\
        \ name. Multiple characters can be matched using the wildcard character '*'.\n\
        #### Severity\nThe severity pattern is matched against an event's severity.\
        \ Multiple severities can be specified in a comma separated list. A single\
        \ wildcard '*' will match all severities. Valid values are:\n- emergency\n\
        - alert\n- error\n- notice\n- informational\n- debug\n#### SNMP trap type\n\
        The SNMP trap type pattern is matched against an event's trap type. Multiple\
        \ trap types can be specified in a comma separated list. A single wildcard\
        \ '*' matches all trap types. Valid values are:\n- standard\n- built_in\n\
        - severity_based\n## Examples\n### Retrieving a list of filters whose names\

  Getting started with the ONTAP REST API:
    x-ntap-long-description:
      description: "## Overview\nLet's review some key things about RESTful APIs and\
        \ how they're implemented in ONTAP:\n* REST API URLs identify the resources\
        \ that you'll be working with, including clusters, SVMs, and storage.\n* REST\
        \ APIs use HTTP methods GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE, and OPTIONS to indicate\
        \ their actions.\n* REST APIs return common HTTP status codes to indicate\
        \ the results of each call. Additional error details can be included in the\
        \ results body.\n* REST APIs request and response bodies are encoded using\
        \ JSON.\n* REST APIs support hyperlinking among resources using the Content-Type\
        \ \"application/hal+json\".\n* GET calls on collections usually return only\
        \ name and UUID by default. If you want to retrieve additional properties,\
        \ you need to specify them using the “fields” query parameter.\n* ONTAP supports\
        \ query-based DELETE or PATCH for all collection endpoints.\n###\nIf you're\
        \ already familiar with the ONTAPI API (also known as ZAPI), there are some\
        \ similarities between ONTAP REST APIs and ONTAPI. For example:\n* Both support\
        \ the same transport and security mechanisms.\n* Both paginate results based\
        \ on either number of seconds or number of records.\n* Both support filtering\
        \ the returned records based on property values.\n* Both support limiting\
        \ the returned properties.\n###\nHowever, there are important differences\
        \ between REST APIs and the ONTAP CLI and ONTAPI that you should understand\
        \ as well:\n* In many cases, ONTAP REST APIs use different names for fields\
        \ and features.\n* REST APIs do not expose infrequently used CLI parameters.\n\
        * REST APIs do not treat the cluster or nodes as an SVM (aka Vserver).\n*\
        \ REST GET APIs support specifying a maximum time before paginating results.\
        \ However, the default time is 15 seconds for REST (instead of 90 seconds\
        \ for ONTAPI).\n* REST APIs are generally ordered by UUID or ID, so a rename\
        \ operation using the PATCH method doesn't change the path keys.\n* REST APIs\
        \ use one or more of the following properties to identify a resource: \"name\"\
        , \"uuid\", \"id\".\n* REST APIs often execute the equivalent of multiple\
        \ CLI commands in a single request.\n* REST API properties use underscores\
        \ instead of hyphens between words.\n* REST API dates are always in ISO-8601\
        \ format.\n* REST API comparisons between enum values (for <, >, ranges, and\
        \ `order_by`) are done alphabetically. (In CLI and ONTAPI, enum comparisions\
        \ are done based on an internal value for the enum.)\n* REST API field '<'\
        \ queries exclude records where the specified field is not set. You can add\
        \ \"|null\" (eg: limit=<10|null) to also return records where the specified\
        \ field is not set.\n"

  HAL linking:
    x-ntap-long-description:
      description: "## Hypertext Application Language (HAL)\nONTAP REST APIs use HAL\
        \ as the mechanism to support Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State\
        \ (HATEOAS). When an object or attribute is returned that identifies a specific\
        \ resource, a HAL-encoded link is also returned so that you can easily discover\
        \ resources and be able to obtain more details about the resource.\n## Example\n\
        ```\n\"aggregate\": {\n    \"uuid\": \"19425837-f2fa-4a9f-8f01-712f626c983c\"\

        \ supported, calls on a collection to create the supplied resource\n* PATCH:\
        \ When supported, calls on a specific resource to update the supplied properties\n\
        * DELETE: When supported, calls on a specific resource to delete the resource\n\
        * HEAD: Supported wherever GET is supported. It makes a GET call, but only\

  Query-based PATCH and DELETE:
    x-ntap-long-description:
      description: "## Overview\nAlthough they are not documented as individual methods\
        \ in the list of REST APIs, every API supporting PATCH or DELETE on a resource\
        \ instance also supports PATCH or DELETE on the collection as long as at least\
        \ one field is specified in the query portion of the URL. A PATCH or DELETE\
        \ method issued on a collection is equivalent to internally doing a query-based\
        \ GET, followed by a serial PATCH or DELETE operation on each matching record.\
        \ However, it only does the operation for `return_timeout` seconds, which\
        \ is 15 seconds by default. If a query-based operation is not completed before\
        \ `return_timeout` seconds, the API returns a next link. The client must use\
        \ the next link with the same HTTP method to continue the operation. Query-based\
        \ operations will not continue to the next record until the operation on the\
        \ prior record is completed, even for operations that are normally asynchronous.\n\
        ## Example\n```\n# Modify the state of all volumes named \"simpson\" to be\
        \ offline\nPATCH /api/storage/volumes?name=simpson\n{ \"state\": \"offline\"\

  Records and pagination:

        <br/>\n```\nreturn_records=<true|false>\n```\n<br/>The default setting for\
        \ `return_records` is `true` for GET calls and `false` for all other methods.\
        \ When `false`, the array of records is not returned.\n<br/>\n```\nreturn_timeout=<0..120\
        \ seconds>\n```\n<br/>The `return_timeout` parameter specifies the number\
        \ of seconds the cluster spends performing an operation before returning.\
        \ The allowed range is `0` to `120` seconds. If the timeout is reached, GET\
        \ calls return the records collected along with a pagination link. Other methods\
        \ return and complete asynchronously. See Non-blocking-operations for more\
        \ details.\n<br/>The default setting for `return_timeout` is `15` seconds\
        \ for GET calls. For all other methods it is `0` seconds. This means that\
        \ these calls might execute asynchronously in order to return as fast as possible.\n\
        <br/>Note: If the `order_by` parameter is specified, the operation might take\
        \ longer because the collection is sorted before it is returned.\n<br/>\n\
        ```\nmax_records=<number of records>\n```\n<br/>The `max_records` parameter\
        \ limits the number of records that are returned (or acted on) before providing\
        \ the \"next\" pagination link.\n ## Pagination\n All calls to GET on a resource\
        \ collection allow you to page through the results. If the `max_records` parameter\
        \ is not specified, the cluster returns as many records as possible within\
        \ the `return_timeout` time threshold. The number of records returned can\
        \ be further limited by specifying a value for the `max_records` parameter.\
        \ When the operation reaches either the `return_timeout` or the `max_records`\
        \ threshold, it stops and returns the records as well as a HAL link that can\
        \ be used to get the next page of records. It is possible for a pagination\
        \ link to be returned even if there are no additional records. This occurs\
        \ because the cluster does not check if there is an additional record before\
        \ returning when it reaches a threshold. When there are potentially additional\
        \ records, the response header will also contain a `Link` header containing\
        \ the link followed by `rel=\"next\"`.\n<br/>The following is an example of\
        \ the \"next\" link, which returns with a collection of records:\n<br/>\n\
        ```\n\"_links\": {\n    \"next\": {\n        \"href\": \"/api/storage/aggregates?start.aggregate=aggr25&max_records=25\"\
        \n    }\n}\n```\n## Count only\nThe response to collection operations includes\
        \ a `num_records` field. By passing `return_records=false` with a GET call,\
        \ you can retrieve the number of records without returning the records themselves.\
        \ However, if either the `return_timeout` or `max_records` threshold is reached,\
        \ an incomplete or partial number of records is returned and the \"next\"\
        \ link must be called to retrieve additional record counts. All the partial\
        \ counts must be added together to calculate the total count.\n## Filtering\
        \ records\nYou can filter the results of a GET call using any attribute. The\
        \ supplied query can either be for an exact value or can leverage special\
        \ query operators.\n<br/>\n```\n<field>=<query value>\n```\n<br/>Filtering\
        \ allows you to select objects where the specified field matches the supplied\
        \ query, or which can contain wildcards, ranges, negations, or an OR-defined\
        \ list of the above. The special query operators include the following:\n\
        ### Wildcard: `*`\n```\nabc*\nabc*xyz\n*xyz\n```\n### Comparison: `<   > \
        \  <=   >=`\n```\n<10\n>=joe\n```\n### Range: `..`\n```\n3..10\njim..joe\n\
        ```\n### Negation: `!`\n```\n!3\n!joe\n!abc*\n!jim..joe\n```\n### Any of a\
        \ list: `|`\n```\n3|5\n3|5..9|>100\n```\n### Escaping: `{} and \"\"`\nThe\
        \ special query characters above can be treated literally, with no special\
        \ meaning, by enclosing the value in either double quotes or curly braces.\n\
        <br/>\n```\n\"joe*\"\n{a|b}\n```\n"

  Requesting-specific-fields:
    x-ntap-long-description:
      description: "## Overview\nBy default, calling GET on a collection generally\
        \ returns only the properties that uniquely identify the record, along with\
        \ a HAL 'self' link to the resource instance. However, you can choose the\
        \ specific fields you want using the `fields` parameter. The `fields` parameter\
        \ can also be used with GET when retrieving a single resource instance.\n\
        <br/>For discovery purposes, except for the CLI passthrough, the client can\
        \ retrieve all standard properties using `fields=\\*`. These are the same\
        \ properties returned when a GET is called on the specific instance using\
        \ the path keys. However, using `fields=\\*` is more expensive than selecting\
        \ only the specific fields that are needed. In addition, because future releases\
        \ may include additional properties in this list, or remove properties that\
        \ were included by default, we strongly discourage using this in client-side\
        \ software that is depending on specific fields being returned.\n<br/>Some\
        \ fields are more expensive to retrieve and are not included when using `fields=\\\
        *` (or the instance-level GET). These fields are noted in the documentation.\
        \ They can be returned either by specifying the fields directly, or by using\
        \ `fields=\\*\\*`. However, we again strongly discourage this from being encoded\
        \ into any client-side software. The performance of client software will suffer\
        \ if a future version of ONTAP adds support for additional expensive properties.\n\
        <br/>\n```\nfields=<field>[,...]\n```\n<br/>The `fields` input parameter allows\
        \ you to specify exactly which fields you want to be returned.\n## Objects\
        \ with fields\nWhen an API contains fields that are objects, an entire object\
        \ can be specified to return every field within the object. Individual fields\
        \ within the object can be specified using dotted notation, as demonstrated\
        \ below. Occasionally, some APIs might not support specifying fields nested\
        \ within certain objects. Note: Dotted notation for arrays does not include\
        \ array indices.\n## Examples\n```\n{\n  \"a\": \"<string>\",\n  \"b\": {\n\
        \    \"c\": \"<string>\",\n    \"d\": \"<string>\"\n  },\n  \"e\": [\n   \
        \ {\n      \"f\": \"<string1>\",\n      \"g\": \"<string1>\"\n    },\n   \
        \ {\n      \"f\": \"<string2>\",\n      \"g\": \"<string2>\"\n    }\n  ]\n\
        }\n```\nExample `fields` query:\n```\nfields=a,b     // Fetch a, b.c, and\
        \ b.d\nfields=a,b.c,e // Fetch a, b.c, e.f, and e.g\nfields=b.d     // Fetch\
        \ b.d\nfields=e.f     // Fetch e.f\nfields=b,!b.c  // Fetch b.*, but not b.c\n\

  Sorting records:
    x-ntap-long-description:
      description: "## Overview\nBy default, records in a collection are returned\
        \ in the order defined by the object. You can change the order by specifying\
        \ the `order_by` query parameter. Most uses of the `order_by` parameter collect\
        \ and reorder _all records_ in the collection. This can be expensive when\
        \ the collection is large. Therefore, clients are discouraged from paginating\
        \ through the results with `max_records` when using `order_by`.\n<br/>\n```\n\
        order_by=<field [asc|desc]>[,...]\n```\n<br/>If you want to sort on multiple\
        \ fields (where the prior key value is the same), separate any fields (and\
        \ optional direction) with a comma.\n<br/>By default, sorting is done in ascending\
        \ order based on the field type's ordering. If `desc` is specified after a\
        \ field name, that field is sorted in descending order. Combining this with\
        \ `max_records` allows you to see the `top` or `bottom` records based on the\
        \ value of the specified field(s). When using this `top` or `bottom` functionality,\
        \ queries on certain fields might require more time to search the entire collection\
        \ regardless of the number of records actually returned.\n<br/>Note: When\
        \ you use the `order_by` parameter, the `return_timeout` might be exceeded\
        \ because the collection is sorted before it is returned.\n## Examples\n```\n\
        # Sort the volume collection from largest to smallest by size:\nGET /api/storage/volumes?order_by=size\
        \ desc\n# Find the top 5 applications using the most IOPS:\nGET /api/application/applications?order_by=statistics.iops.total\
        \ desc,name asc&max_records=5\n# Find the top 10 applications using the most\

  Using the private CLI passthrough with the ONTAP REST API:
    x-ntap-long-description:
      description: "## REST API access to CLI commands\nTo help CLI and ONTAP users\
        \ transition to the ONTAP REST API, ONTAP 9.6 provides a private REST API\
        \ endpoint that can be used to access any CLI command. Usage of this API call\
        \ is recorded and returned in the AutoSupport data collection so that NetApp\
        \ can identify usablity and functionality improvements in the REST API for\
        \ future releases. There is no per-API documentation for the REST API access\
        \ for each CLI command. Unlike the documented REST APIs, the API paths and\
        \ properties for the CLI passthrough correspond very closely to the CLI. There\
        \ are several rules that govern all the differences between a CLI command\
        \ and the REST API mirroring the CLI command.\n### Rules for path differences\
        \ when accessing a CLI command through the REST API\nThe API paths mirror\
        \ the CLI paths, except for the use of the \"show\", \"create\", \"modify\"\
        , and \"delete\" verbs. Instead of using these four CLI verbs in the REST\
        \ API, the corresponding HTTP methods must be used (GET, POST, PATCH, and\
        \ DELETE). The four CLI verbs are removed from the API path supporting a command.\
        \ For any commands where the last verb is hyphenated and begins with one of\
        \ these verbs (for example, \"show-space\" or \"delete-all\"), you must remove\
        \ the verb and following hyphen from the path. Any space in a full command\
        \ path becomes a forward slash in the REST API (for example, \"system node\"\
        \ becomes \"/api/private/cli/system/node\"). For non-show CLI commands that\
        \ use non-standard verbs, the POST method should be used on the full path\
        \ with the final verb in the API path. For example, \"volume rehost\" becomes\
        \ \"POST /api/private/cli/volume/rehost\" and \"cluster add-node\" becomes\
        \ \"POST /api/private/cli/cluster/add-node\".\n<br/>To know which HTTP methods\
        \ are supported for an API call, both documented and CLI-based, clients can\
        \ use the \"OPTIONS\" HTTP method. For example, using OPTIONS on \"/api/private/cli/volume\"\
        \ returns 'OK' with the HTTP \"Allow\" header containing a list of the supported\
        \ HTTP methods (for example, \"Allow: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, POST, DELETE, PATCH\"\
        ). For feature-specific CLI verbs, you can use OPTIONS on the API path. For\
        \ example, using OPTIONS on \"/api/private/cli/volume/restrict\" returns with\
        \ the HTTP header \"Allow: OPTIONS, POST\". Some of the CLI \"show\" commands\
        \ do not contain the standard verb. For example, calling OPTIONS on \"/api/private/cli/cluster/add-node-status\"\
        \ returns \"Allow: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS\".\n<br/>There are some commands in\
        \ the CLI that will not work using REST APIs. This includes most show commands\
        \ that do not support \"show -fields\" in the CLI. The REST API also does\
        \ not support CLI commands that create a new shell (like \"run\" and \"vserver\
        \ context\").\n<br/>Here are several examples of mappings from the ONTAP CLI\
        \ to the ONTAP REST API for the /api/private/cli path:\n* volume show    \
        \   &rarr; GET /api/private/cli/volume\n* volume create     &rarr; POST /api/private/cli/volume\n\
        * volume modify     &rarr; PATCH /api/private/cli/volume\n* volume delete\
        \     &rarr; DELETE /api/private/cli/volume\n* volume restrict   &rarr; POST\
        \ /api/private/cli/volume/restrict\n* volume show-space        &rarr; GET\
        \ /api/private/cli/volume/space\n* volume show-footprint    &rarr; GET /api/private/cli/volume/footprint\n\
        * cluster add-node         &rarr; POST /api/private/cli/cluster/add-node\n\
        * cluster add-node-status  &rarr; GET /api/private/cli/system/node/add-node-status\n\
        * system node coredump show       &rarr; GET /api/private/cli/system/node/coredump\n\
        * system node coredump delete     &rarr; DELETE /api/private/cli/system/node/coredump\n\
        * system node coredump delete-all &rarr; DELETE /api/private/cli/system/node/coredump/all\n\
        ### Rules for field differences when accessing a CLI command through the REST\
        \ API\nAll CLI parameters are supported in the CLI-based REST APIs. However,\
        \ REST converts hyphens (-) in CLI parameter names to underscores (_) in the\
        \ REST API JSON response body. In general, REST API responses use the same\
        \ formatting for property values as ONTAPI. For example, enumerated values\
        \ are formatted in lowercase instead of uppercase and with underscores instead\
        \ of hyphens in the REST API response body. Both CLI and ONTAPI formats are\
        \ allowed on input. Also similar to ONTAPI, sizes and percentages in REST\
        \ are encoded as integers in bytes. Unlike ONTAPI or the CLI, date and time\
        \ values in REST are encoded with the ISO-8601 format. All fields that you\
        \ want returned from the GET call must be specified using the `fields` parameter.\
        \ Note that the /api/private/cli/... APIs do not support \"fields=*\".\n##\
        \ Examples\nRetrieve OPTIONS for volumes endpoint (with results contained\
        \ in header):\n```\ncurl -X OPTIONS \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/private/cli/volume\"\
        \ --include\nAllow: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, POST, DELETE, PATCH\n{\n}\n```\n<br>GET\
        \ size and percent-used for all volumes:\n```\ncurl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/private/cli/volume?fields=size,percent-used&pretty=false\"\
        \n{\n  \"records\": [\n    { \"vserver\": \"vs1\", \"volume\": \"vol1\", \"\
        size\": 20971520, \"percent_used\": 73 },\n    { \"vserver\": \"vs1\", \"\
        volume\": \"vol2\", \"size\": 20971520, \"percent_used\": 87 },\n    ...\n\
        \  ]\n}\n```\n<br>GET size and percent-used for a specific volume:\n```\n\
        curl -X GET \"https://<mgmt-ip>/api/private/cli/volume?volume=vol2&pretty=false\"\

        \ DELETE calls on the command path (using queries on key fields in the query\

        As shown in the previous example, any non-field and non-error based output\
        \ that would have appeared in the CLI is returned in a top-level `cli_output`\
        \ attribute in the response body. This does not contain normal CLI headers\
        \ or field values. It only displays messages that were printed to the CLI.\n\
        ## HTTP status codes\nError codes in the response body are mapped to the most\
        \ appropriate HTTP status codes. In cases where this is not done, the HTTP\
        \ status code defaults to 500. This does not necessarily indicate that the\
        \ error is internal to ONTAP.\n## Security\nAll CLI-based REST APIs are RBAC-controlled,\
        \ based on the role of the authenticated user and have the same protections\
        \ they have in the CLI.\n## Location of CLI fields for CLI-based REST APIs:\n\
        * POST APIs: All CLI fields must be provided in the request body.\n* GET APIs:\
        \ All desired CLI fields (except keys) must be specified in the `fields` parameter.\
        \ The non-key fields returned via the CLI will not be returned if not requested.\
        \ The client can also provide a query for any field.\n* PATCH APIs: The client\
        \ can provide a query for any field, but at least one field must have a query.\
        \ To modify only a single record, all CLI keys must contain an exact query.\
        \ All new values for the object must be provided in the request body.\n* DELETE\
        \ APIs: The client can provide a query for any field, but at least one field\
        \ must have a query. To delete only a single record, all CLI keys must contain\
        \ an exact query. Non-attribute inputs (such as `force`) must be provided\
        \ in the query portion of the URI.\n"
