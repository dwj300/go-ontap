## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Compaction** | **string** | The system can be enabled/disabled compaction.&lt;br&gt;inline &amp;dash; Data will be compacted first and written to the volume.&lt;br&gt;none &amp;dash; None&lt;br&gt;mixed &amp;dash; Read only field for FlexGroups, where some of the constituent volumes are compaction enabled and some are disabled. | [optional] [default to null]
**Compression** | **string** | The system can be enabled/disabled compression.&lt;br&gt;inline &amp;dash; Data will be compressed first and written to the volume.&lt;br&gt;background &amp;dash; Data will be written to the volume and compressed later.&lt;br&gt;both &amp;dash; Inline compression compresses the data and write to the volume, background compression compresses only the blocks on which inline compression is not run.&lt;br&gt;none &amp;dash; None&lt;br&gt;mixed &amp;dash; Read only field for FlexGroups, where some of the constituent volumes are compression enabled and some are disabled. | [optional] [default to null]
**CrossVolumeDedupe** | **string** | The system can be enabled/disabled cross volume dedupe. it can be enabled only when dedupe is enabled.&lt;br&gt;inline &amp;dash; Data will be cross volume deduped first and written to the volume.&lt;br&gt;background &amp;dash; Data will be written to the volume and cross volume deduped later.&lt;br&gt;both &amp;dash; Inline cross volume dedupe dedupes the data and write to the volume, background cross volume dedupe dedupes only the blocks on which inline dedupe is not run.&lt;br&gt;none &amp;dash; None&lt;br&gt;mixed &amp;dash; Read only field for FlexGroups, where some of the constituent volumes are cross volume dedupe enabled and some are disabled. | [optional] [default to null]
**Dedupe** | **string** | The system can be enabled/disabled dedupe.&lt;br&gt;inline &amp;dash; Data will be deduped first and written to the volume.&lt;br&gt;background &amp;dash; Data will be written to the volume and deduped later.&lt;br&gt;both &amp;dash; Inline dedupe dedupes the data and write to the volume, background dedupe dedupes only the blocks on which inline dedupe is not run.&lt;br&gt;none &amp;dash; None&lt;br&gt;mixed &amp;dash; Read only field for FlexGroups, where some of the constituent volumes are dedupe enabled and some are disabled. | [optional] [default to null]
